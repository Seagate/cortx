 ## CORTX Quick Start Guide
 
This document presents the most common methods by which interested parties can test, install, run, deploy, and ultimately potentially contribute, to CORTX.  CORTX is available in multiple formats.  It is available as a pre-built virtual machine image which presents the easiest path to install, deploy, and test it.  It is also available as source code which can be built into binary formats for installing, deploying, and testing.  Finally, it is possible to install, deploy, and test different configurations of CORTX ranging from the full installation to just the core object storage layer (motr) by itself).  We have attempted to create easy-to-follow instructions for all of these installation/test methods which are organized below in order of difficulty.
 
 1. Run a pre-built CORTX OVA (virtual machine image)
    1. On a single node: [LINK](doc/CORTX_on_Open_Virtual_Appliance.rst)
    1. Run it on an AWS EC2 instance [LINK](doc/integrations/AWS_EC2.md)
    1. Across a cluster: TODO
1. Build motr from the source: [LINK](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/doc/Quick-Start-Guide.rst)

Note that some of the links above are tagged 'requires verification' and some are tagged 'LINK'.  We apply the 'LINK' tag only after instructions have been verified by at least two people.  The 'required verification' instructions are instructions which are still awaiting a second verification.  If you verify them, please add your name to the 'Tested By' section at the bottom of the page and change the tag on this page as well.
