# Contribute to the CORTX Project

CORTX is about building the world's best scalable mass-capacity object storage system. If you’re interested in what we’re building and intrigued by hard challenges, here's everything you need to know about contributing to the project and how to get started. 

This guide is intended to provide quick start instructions for developers who want to build, test, and contribute to the CORTX software.  If you are merely looking to _test_ CORTX, please use [these instructions](doc/CORTX_on_Open_Virtual_Appliance.rst).

After reading this guide, you'll be able to pick up topics and issues to contribute, submit your codes, and how to turn your pull request into a successful contribution. And if you have any suggestions on how we can improve this guide, or anything else in the project, we want to hear from you!

## Contribution Process

### Prerequisites

- Please read our [CORTX Code Style Guide](doc/CodeStyle.md).
- Get started with [GitHub Tools and Procedures](doc/GitHub_Processes_and_Tools.rst), if you are new to GitHub.
   - Please find additional information about [working with git](doc/working_with_git.md) specific to CORTX.
- Please read about our [DCO and CLA policies](doc/dco_cla.md).

### Development

**Development Environment:** First you need to configure your [development environment](doc/BUILD_ENVIRONMENT.md). 

**Core Functionality:** For basic development and testing of CORTX, you only need the motr and S3 submodules.

1. [CORTX Motr](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/doc/Quick-Start-Guide.rst)
   - The main data path of the system responsible for the actual storage and distribution of objects and key-value pairs.
2. [CORTX S3](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-s3server/blob/main/docs/CORTX-S3%20Server%20Quick%20Start%20Guide.md)
   - The S3 interface to CORTX.

**Complete System:** For the complete CORTX experience, you will need to install the remaining submodules:

1. [CORTX HA](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-ha/blob/main/Quick-Start-Guide.rst)
   - The module responsible for maintaining highly available access to shared storage.
2. [CORTX Hare](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-hare/blob/main/README.md)
   - The module responsible for monitoring the distributed health of the system and maintaining consensus.   
3. [CORTX Management Portal](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-management-portal/blob/main/README.md)
   - The module providing a user interface for management and monitoring of CORTX.   
4. [CORTX Manager](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-manager/blob/main/README.md)
   - The module providing API's with which the management portal communicates with the other modules.   
5. [CORTX Monitor](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-monitor/blob/main/cortx-monitorQuickstartGuide.md)
   - The module tracking platform health and raising alerts on sensing any unintended state.   
6. [CORTX POSIX](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-posix/blob/main/doc/Quick_Start_Guide.md)
   - The module providing a file interface to CORTX.  
7. [CORTX Provisioner](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-prvsnr/blob/main/Cortx-ProvisionerQuickstartGuide.md)
   - The module which assists the users is satisfying dependencies, configuring the components and the other modules, and initializing the CORTX environment.
