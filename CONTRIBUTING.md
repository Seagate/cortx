## Contribution Process

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>
<p>

- Please read our [CORTX Code Style Guide](../main/doc/CodeStyle.md).

- Get started with [GitHub Tools and Procedures](../doc/Tools.rst), if you are new to GitHub.

- Before you set up your GitHub, you'll need to

  1. Generate the SSH key on your development box using:

     ```shell
     $ ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Email-address"
     ```
  2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub Account:
    1. Copy the public key: `id_rsa.pub`. By default, your public key is located at `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    2. Navigate to [GitHub SSH key settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) on your GitHub account.
      
    :page_with_curl:**Note:** Ensure that you've set your Email ID as the Primary Email Address associated with your GitHub Account. 
    
    3. Paste the SSH key you generated in Step 1 and click **Add SSH key**.
    5. [Create a Personal Access Token or PAT](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).
      
 - Update Git to the latest version. If you're on an older version, you'll see errors in your commit hooks that look like this:

    `$ git commit`

     **Sample Output**
  
    ```shell

    git: 'interpret-trailers' is not a git command.
    See 'git --help'
    cannot insert change-id line in .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
    ```

- Install Fix for CentOS 7.x by using: `$ yum remove git`
  * Download the [RPM file from here](https://packages.endpoint.com/rhel/7/os/x86_64/endpoint-repo-1.7-1.x86_64.rpm) and run the following commands:
  
    ```shell
       $ yum -y install
       $ yum -y install git
    ```

### 2. Clone the CORTX Repository

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
<p>

Before you can work on a GitHub feature, you'll need to clone the repository you're working on. **Fork** the repository to clone it into your private GitHub repository and follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the repository homepage on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork**
3. Run the following commands in Shell:
   
   `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Seagate/<repository>.git`

4. You'll need to setup the upstream repository in the remote list. This is a one-time activity. Run the following command to view the configured remote repository for your fork.
    
   `$ git remote -v`  

    **Sample Output:**
    
    ```shell
    
     origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     ```

 5. Set up the upstream repository in the remote list using:
   
    `$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seagate/<repository>.git`
      
    `$ git remote -v`

     **Sample Output:**
    
     ```shell
    
     origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     ```
    
6. Check out to your branch using:

   `$ git checkout "branchname"`

   `$ git checkout -b 'your-local-branch-name`
   
    :page_with_curl: **Note:** By default, you'll need to contribute to the main branch. 

</p>
</details>

### 3. Commit your Code

:page_with_curl: **Note:** At any point in time to rebase your local branch to the latest main branch, follow these steps:

  ```shell

  $ git pull origin main
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ git checkout 'your-local-branch'
  $ git pull origin 'your-remote-branch-name'
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ git rebase origin/main
  ```
  
You can make changes to the code and save them in your files.

1. Use the command below to add files that need to be pushed to the git staging area:

    `$ git add foo/somefile.cc`

2. To commit your code changes use:

   `$ git commit -s -m ‘comment’` - enter your GitHub Account ID and an appropriate Feature or Change description in comment.

3. Check out your git log to view the details of your commit and verify the author name using: `$ git log`

   :page_with_curl:**Note:** If you need to change the author name for your commit, refer to the GitHub article on [Changing author info](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-author-info).

4. To Push your changes to GitHub, use: `$ git push origin 'your-local-branch-name'`

   **Sample Output**

   ```shell

   Enumerating objects: 4, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.

  <p>       
   
1. Once you Push changes to GitHub, the output will display a URL for creating a Pull Request, as shown in the sample code above.

   :page_with_curl:**Note:** To resolve conflicts, follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in git error messages.

2. You'll be redirected to GitHib remote.

### 5. Run Jenkins and System Tests

Creating a pull request automatically triggers Jenkins jobs and System tests. To familiarize yourself with jenkins, please visit the [Jenkins wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)).

### 6. Sign CLA and Pass DCO 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>
  <p>

#### CLA

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, CORTX Community may require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

#### DCO

DCO is always required. The code reviewers will use the [decision tree](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/dco_cla.md) to determine when CLA is required.
To ensure contributions can be redistributed by all under an open source license, all contributions must be signed with [DCO](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/cla-vs-dco-whats-difference). To further ensure that all members of the community can redistribute and resell CORTX should and when they so choose, [CLA may be required on a case-by-case basis](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/cla/README.md) such that corporations cannot attempt to prevent others from reselling CORTX.

You can pass DCO in many ways:

- While creating a Pull Request via the GitHub UI, add `Signed-off-by: "Name" <email address>` in the PR comments section. 

   **Example:** `Signed-off-by: John Doe <John.doe@gmail.com>`

- DCO will automatically pass if you push commits using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/configuring-git-for-github-desktop). 

- You can pass DCO by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages in Git CLI:

   `Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>`
   
    Git even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

   `$ git commit -s -m` - here -m is your commit message.

## The GitHub Triage Process

Triaging is about prioritizing and troubleshooting issues raised by you in [GitHub](https://github.com/). Triage can broadly be defined as a process oriented approach towards issue resolution and conflict management.

<details>
  <summary>Process of Triaging</summary>
  <p>

The process of triaging in CORTX is depicted in the diagram below.
