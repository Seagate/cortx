# Glossary for CORTX on Kubernetes

This page will serve as a clearinghouse for all terms, definitions, and acronyms critical to both the understanding of and having success with [CORTX](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx). Please feel free to add terms as needed but place them in proper alphabetical order.

## Glossary

### CatalogSource

A [CatalogSource](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/crds/catalogsource/), or more simply Catalog, is a CustomResourceDefinition defined by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) and represents a store of metadata that OLM can query to discover and install operators and their dependencies.

### ClusterServiceVersion (CSV)

A [ClusterServiceVersion](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/0.15.1/doc/design/building-your-csv.md) is the metadata that accompanies your Operator container image when an Operator is deployed through the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM). It can be used to populate user interfaces with info like your logo/description/version and it is also a source of technical information needed to run the Operator, like the role-based access control rules it requires and which Custom Resources it manages or depends on.

### Container

Per [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container), a container, or sometimes referred to as a Linux container, is "a set of 1 or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system. All the files necessary to run them are provided from a distinct image, meaning Linux containers are portable and consistent as they move from development, to testing, and finally to production."

### CORVAULT

[CORVAULT](https://www.seagate.com/products/storage/data-storage-systems/corvault/) is the brand name for a specific Seagate storage hardware product. CORVAULT generally belongs to a category of storage referred to as RBOD (reliable bunch of disks). Physically, CORVAULT is a large 4U rack enclosure which holds up to 106 devices. By virtue of firmware running inside the enclosure, CORVAULT appears to the upper-layer host (CORTX in our case) as two very large individual disks. Internally, CORVAULT does declustered erasure such that the frequency of "disk" failures seen by the host is very low (albeit when they happen, they are a large failure).

### CORTX Control Pods

CORTX Control Pods contain the APIs which are exposed to the end-user in order to maintain the CORTX control plane and are most often used to interact with IAM settings.

### CORTX Core

The smallest, atomic deployable unit of the CORTX stack is sometimes referred to as "CORTX Core". This includes the CORTX Control, CORTX RGW, CORTX Cluster Coordinator (nee HA), and CORTX Data components, along with the third-party prerequisites of Apache Kafka and HashiCorpâ€™s Consul.

### CORTX Data Pods

CORTX Data Pods contain the internal APIs which are used to manage the storage and protection of data at the lowest possible level inside of a CORTX cluster.

### CORTX HA (High Availability) Pods

CORTX HA Pods are responsible for monitoring the overall health of the CORTX cluster and notifying components of changes in system status.

### CORTX Server Pods

CORTX Server Pods contain the APIs which are exposed to the end-user in order to provide general S3 functionality - create buckets, copy objects, delete objects, delete buckets. This API layer is implemented using the Rados Gateway (RGW) interface.

### CustomResource (CR)

A CustomResource, or CR, is an instance of the CustomResourceDefinition a Kubernetes Operator ships that represents the Operand or an Operation on the Operand.

### CustomResourceDefinition

A CustomResourceDefinition, or CRD, is an API of a Kubernetes Operator, providing the blueprint and validation rules for Custom Resources.

### CVG (Cylinder Volume Group)

A Cylinder Volume Group, or CVG, is a collection of drives or block devices which CORTX utilizes as a unit of storage, all managed by a single Motr IO process.

### Data Devices / Drives

Block devices, HDDs, SDDs, or other types of storage devices addressable by `/dev/{device-name}` which CORTX uses to store user data.

### Finalizers

[Finalizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) are namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion. Finalizers alert controllers to clean up resources the deleted object owned.

### Helm

Commonly known as "the package manager for Kubernetes", [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a CLI tool that builds and deploys Kubernetes applications through application packages known as Helm Charts.

### JBOD

JBOD stands for "Just a Bunch of Disks" and refers to a rack enclosure containing many disks which are each individually exposed to the host (CORTX in our case).

### kubelet

The [kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. It can register the node with the apiserver using one of: the hostname; a flag to override the hostname; or specific logic for a cloud provider.

### KUDO

[KUDO](https://kudo.dev/), which stands for the Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator, is a toolkit used to build Kubernetes Operators, in most cases just using YAML.

### kustomize

Per the offifical [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) site, "Kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is." Kustomize is used in conjunction with `kubectl` for advanced customization and robust templating for Kubernetes application deployment and management.

### Liveness Probe

The kubelet uses [liveness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock where an application is running but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.

### Managed resources

Managed resources are the Kubernetes objects (Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, PersistentVolumes, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.) the Operator uses to constitute an Operand.

### Metadata Devices / Drives

Block devices, HDDs, SDDs, or other types of storage devices addressable by `/dev/{device-name}` which CORTX uses to store metadata about user data.

### Motr

Motr is the central storage capability inside of a CORTX cluster. It functions as a distributed object and key-value storage system targeting mass-capacity storage configurations.

### Node

This term is unfortunately overloaded in the context of CORTX on Kubernetes. It can either mean an underlying Kubernetes worker node (in general) or it can mean any single component working inside of the CORTX cluster (Data Pod, Server Pod, Control Pod, etc.).

Context is important and required to discern when which is which. Through the https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-k8s repository, care is used to refer to Kubernetes worker nodes as "Nodes" and CORTX nodes running on Kubernetes as "Pods".

### Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

The [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/) is an optional set of Kubernetes cluster resources that can manage the lifecycle of an Operator. The Operator SDK supports both creating manifests for OLM deployment, and testing your Operator on an OLM-enabled Kubernetes cluster. OLM integration is not a foundational requirement for all Kubernetes Operators.

### Operand

As defined by the [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/overview/operator-capabilities/#terminology), an Operand is the managed workload provided by the Operator as a service.

### Operator

As defined by the [Operator SDK](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/overview/operator-capabilities/#terminology), an Operator is the custom controller installed on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Operator SDK

An [open-source framework](https://sdk.operatorframework.io/), provided by Red Hat, which helps users quickly create functional Kubernetes Operators from Go, Helm, and Ansible scaffolding.

### Pod

Per the [official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/), "Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes." Inside of a CORTX cluster, all relevant containers that need to be contextually grouped together are deployed as a Pod.

### Rados Gateway (RGW)

This is the component which provides all necessary S3 functionality in a CORTX cluster through a central gateway interface.

### RBOD

RBOD means "Reliable Bunch of Drives". Physically it is similar to JBOD but internally it uses erasure or RAID to add better data protection by distributing data across multiple disks and protecting it with parity. Logically, an RBOD will therefore export itself to the host (CORTX in our case) as a smaller number of drives which are much larger in capacity. For example, imagine an RBOD of 100 drives. For high availability reasons, most RBODs will use dual ported drives and will split themselves into two groups of disks. A pair of controllers in the RBOD will provide active-passive access to each pair such that the drives served by the active controller can be instead served by the passive controller in the case of a failure of the active controller. Further imagine, that the RBOD is configured for 8+2 parity within each group of drives. Therefore, to the upper level host, this RBOD will logically appear as just two large drives, each of which being the aggregate size of 40 drives (i.e. 8+2 on 50 drives will use 20% of capacity for parity thereby leaving 80% of capacity for host data).

### Readiness Probe

The kubelet uses [readiness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready. One use of this signal is to control which Pods are used as backends for Services. When a Pod is not ready, it is removed from Service load balancers.

### Startup Probe

The kubelet uses [startup probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/) to know when a container application has started. If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure those probes don't interfere with the application startup. This can be used to adopt liveness checks on slow starting containers, preventing the kubelet from terminating them before they are up and running.

### Storage Set

A Storage Set is the common unit of deployment and scalability for CORTX and its mapping to the underlying infrastructure. A given Kubernetes worker node can only belong to a single Solution Set for the lifetime of a CORTX cluster. A Storage Set is defined as a collection of Kubernetes worker nodes and CVGs.
