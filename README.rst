CORTX: World's Best Scalable Mass-Capacity Object Storage System
==============================================================================

The amount of data the world is creating and collecting is increasing massively. The amount of data the world is storing is not. The models and machine learning that are at the forefront of some of the most important research today depend on access to compete data sets, but limitations on storage lead to unnecessary data loss. By creating better, more economical storage solutions, we enable the research that is changing the world.

The CORTX Project
-----------------

CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for great efficiency, massive capacity, and high HDD-utilization. 

CORTX Project Scope & Core Design Goals
*****************************************

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Project Scope", "Core Design Goals"
   :widths: 20, 80
   
   "Processor", "Agnostic, adapts to any processor."
   "Flexibility", "Highly flexible, works with HDD, SSD, and NVM."
   "Scalability", "Massively Scalable. Scales up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206) and 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects with unlimited object sizes."
   "Responsiveness", "Rapidly Responsive. Quickly retrieves data regardless of the scale using a novel Key-Value System that ensures low search latency across massive data sets."
   "Resilience", "Highly Resilient. Ensures a high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding, while remaining fully RAID-compatible."
   "Transparency", "Provides specialized telemetry data and unmatched insight into system performance."

CORTX Community Values
---------------------

**Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is, too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.

**Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock in or other in-built limitations.

**Inspired** - CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work, ingenuity and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and find inspired solutions.

**Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a community project, there is no limit to its development. We continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects.

We excited for your interest in CORTX and hope you will join us. We take community very seriously and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity as documented in our `Code of conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`_. 

Refer to the CORTX Community Guide **<link placeholder>** that hosts all information about community values, code of conduct, how to contribute code and documentation, community and code style guide, and how to reach out to us.
