CORTX. Hyperscale storage stack capabilities for all.
=====================================================

In consultation with IDC, Seagate has ascertained that an immense amount of data, approximately 175 zettabytes, will be created in 2025. Surprisingly, IDC predicts that only 17 out of these 175 zettabytes of data or 10% will be stored.

IDC predicts that the remaining 158 zettabytes of data with a tremendous amount of unrealized potential, will be discarded. Multiple research efforts have concluded that machine learning and data analytics accuracy directly correlates to the size of the input data set.

Seagate has worked hard to understand both the software and hardware requirements that allow these 158 at-risk zettabytes of data to be stored. We have determined that innovations around the hardware for higher areal density per cost, and software architecture are prohibitively expensive.

We at Seagate have concluded that to overcome the economic limitations of existing systems requires a new software architecture that ensures efficient utilization of co-evolving hardware innovations. To ensure maximum utilization, high code quality, and avoid vendor lock-in, Seagate is open-sourcing CORTX. CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for efficient, mass-capacity, HDD-utilization.

CORTX Community
-----------------------
We are so excited that you took out the time to visit CORTX and read about us. We hope you stick around and consider being part of our
community. We take our community very seriously and committed to our social goals for respectful interactions and inclusivity, as documented in our `Code of Conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.

If this sounds like your kind of place, we bid you a warm welcome!

Early Adopter Program
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before our fully open-source launch, CORTX is in a phase where we are reaching out to our *Early Adopters*. We have made our repositories public and are sharing our development effort with our external community of trusted partners and customers. We thank you all for your willingness and interest in our open-source initiative.

We are flattered that you share our vision for helping the world save more data through open-source object storage!

To know more about our initiative, refer to the `Early Adopter Brief <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/tree/master/doc/SB510_1-2004US_Seagate_CORTX_Community-Brief_R7.2.pdf>`_.

We would be happy to answer your questions or your feedback through our various public communication channels. Please feel free to address your private questions or concerns to `cortx-questions@seagate.com <cortx-questions@seagate.com>`_.

Contribute to CORTX Open-Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please refer to our `Quick Start Guide <QUICK_START.md>`__ to know how you can build, test, and contribute to the code.

To know about our code style guidelines, refer to our `Code Style Guide <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/master/doc/CodeStyle.md>`__.

To find out more about the contributions that we are currently seeking, refer to our
`Suggested Contributions List <doc/SuggestedContributions.md>`__.

Case Studies, Technical Content, and Blog Posts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the goals of our Early Adopter program is to create and collect
content for the public launch of CORTX resources like:

- Case studies
- Contributor stories
- Solution briefs
- Technical content, such as code samples, recipes, API documentation, benchmarks, and reference architectures.

We would also like to hear from you, our contributors - about your experience, use-cases, and contributions for ongoing blog posts. We would be delighted if you would like to share your knowledge and expertise by writing for us or participating in interviews to help us write.

If you solve a challenge, big or small while running or testing the CORTX open-source, reach out to John bent at `John.Bent@seagate.com <John.Bent@seagate.com>`_ to help us develop case studies or other content.

Source Code Browser
""""""""""""""""""

`Opengrok <http://ssc-vm-c-192.colo.seagate.com:8090/source/>`_
is a source code search and cross-reference engine. Please use the Opengrok engine to browse through our repositories. Currently, you can view our repositories only within a Seagate firewall.

Happy code browsing!

**Coming Soon!**
