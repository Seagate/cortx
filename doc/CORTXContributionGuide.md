## Contribution Process

<details>
<summary>Prerequisites</summary>
<p>

- Please read our [Code Style Guide](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/CodeStyle.md).

- Before you set up your GitHub, you'll need to

  1. Generate the SSH key on your development box using:

     ```shell
     $ ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "Email-address"
     ```
  2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub Account:
    1. Copy the public key: `id_rsa.pub`. By default, your public key is located at `/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    2. Navigate to [GitHub SSH key settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) on your GitHub account.
      
    :page_with_curl:**Note:** Ensure that you've set your Email ID as the Primary Email Address associated with your GitHub Account. SSO will not work if you do not set up your Email ID as your Primary Email Address.
    
    3. Paste the SSH key you generated in Step 1 and select *Enable SSO*.
    4. Click **Authorize** to authorize SSO for your SSH key.
    5. [Create a Personal Access Token or PAT](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

     :page_with_curl:**Note:** Ensure that you have enabled SSO for your PAT.
      
 - Update Git to the latest version. If you're on an older version, you'll see errors in your commit hooks that look like this:

      `$ git commit`

      **Sample Output**
  
      ```shell

      git: 'interpret-trailers' is not a git command.
      See 'git --help'
      cannot insert change-id line in .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
      ```

- Install Fix for CentOS 7.x by using: `$ yum remove git`
  * Download the [RPM file from here](https://packages.endpoint.com/rhel/7/os/x86_64/endpoint-repo-1.7-1.x86_64.rpm) and run the following commands:
  
    ```shell
       $ yum -y install
       $ yum -y install git
    ```

   </p>
    </details>

Contributing to the CORTX repository is a six-step process where you'll need to:

1. [Set up Git on your Development Box](#1-Setup-Git-on-your-Development-Box)
2. [Clone the CORTX Repository](#2-Clone-the-CORTX-Repository)
3. [Commit your Code](#3-Commit-your-Code)
4. [Create a Pull Request](#4-Create-a-Pull-Request)
5. [Run Jenkins and System Tests](#5-Run-Jenkins-and-System-Tests)
6. [Sign off the CLA and DCO](

### 1. Setup Git on your Development Box

Once you've installed the prerequisites, follow these steps to set up Git on your Development Box.

<details>
  <summary> Click to expand!</summary>
  <p>

1. Install git-clang-format using: `$ yum install git-clang-format`

2. Set up git config options using:

   ```shell

   $ git config --global user.name ‘Your Name’
   $ git config --global user.email ‘Your.Name@domain_name’
   $ git config --global color.ui auto
   $ git config --global credential.helper cache
   ```
</p>
</details>

### 2. Clone the CORTX Repository

<details>
<summary>Click to expand!</summary>
<p>

Before you can work on a GitHub feature, you'll need to clone the repository you're working on. **Fork** the repository to clone it into your private GitHub repository and follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the repository homepage on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork**
3. Run the following commands in Shell:

   `$ git clone git@github.com:"your-github-id"/repo-name.git`

4. You'll need to setup the upstream repository in the remote list. This is a one-time activity. Run the following command to view the configured remote repository for your fork.
    
       `$ git remote -v`  

      **Sample Output:**
    
        ```shell
    
        origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
        origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
        ```

 5. Set up the upstream repository in the remote list using:
   
      `$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:Seagate/reponame.git
      
      `$ git remote -v`

      **Sample Output:**
    
      ```shell
    
      origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
      origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
      upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
      upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (push)
      ```
    
6. Check out to your branch using:

   `$ git checkout "branchname"`

   `$ git checkout -b 'your-local-branch-name`
   
    :page_with_curl: **Note:** By default, you'll need to contribute to the main branch. However, this differs for various repositories as shown below:
    
   | **Repository**   | **Branch Name** | 
   | :----------------| :-------------: |
   | cortx-s3server   | main            | 
   | cortx-hare       | dev             | 
   | cortx-motr       | dev             |
   | cortx-prvsnr     | main            |
   | cortx-sspl       | dev             |

</p>
</details>

### 3. Commit your Code 

<details>

<p>

:page_with_curl: **Note:** At any point in time to rebase your local branch to the latest main branch, follow these steps:

  ```shell

  $ git pull origin master
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ git checkout 'your-local-branch'
  $ git pull origin 'your-remote-branch-name'
  $ git submodule update --init --recursive
  $ git rebase origin/master
  ```
  
You can make changes to the code and save them in your files.

1. Use the command below to add files that need to be pushed to the git staging area:

    `$ git add foo/somefile.cc`

2. To commit your code changes use:

   `$ git commit -m ‘comment’` - enter your GitHub Account ID and an appropriate Feature or Change description in comment.

3. Check out your git log to view the details of your commit and verify the author name using: `$ git log`

   :page_with_curl:**Note:** If you need to change the author name for your commit, refer to the GitHub article on [Changing author info](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-author-info).

4. To Push your changes to GitHub, use: `$ git push origin 'your-local-branch-name'`

   **Sample Output**

   ```shell

   Enumerating objects: 4, done.
   Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
   Delta compression using up to 2 threads
   Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.

<p>
1. Once you Push changes to GitHub, the output will display a URL for creating a Pull Request, as shown in the sample code above.

:page_with_curl:**Note:** To resolve conflicts, follow the troubleshooting steps mentioned in git error messages.

2. You'll be redirected to GitHib remote.
3. Select the relevant repository branch from the *Branches/Tags* drop-down list.
4. Click **Create pull request** to create the pull request.
5. Add reviewers to your pull request to review and provide feedback on your changes.

</p>
