# Instructions for Seagate Employees

For Seagate employees who are _not_ in the CORTX Team, virtual machine images can be requested and run out of a Seagate managed internal self-service cloud.  These instructions therefore only are relevant to Seagate employees who are _not_ members of the CORTX team.  Please email cortx-questions@seagate.com from your Seagate email account to request access.

For Seagate employees are in the CORTX Team, please talk to the CORTX Infrastructure team about getting access to a virtual machine for testing.
