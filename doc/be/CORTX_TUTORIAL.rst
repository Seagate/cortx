**EU R&D: Strategic focus for the team**
========================================



-  Develop new software technology suitable for future CORTX based
   products

   -  Execute Collaborative R&D projects (Sage2, Maestro, EsiWACE2) in
      the EU

   -  Developing an early adopter ecosystem around them (software and
      user)

-  Continue to bring in external funding to Execute

   -  Primarily the EU

   -  Focus on follow on projects (Sage3, etc)

-  Promote Open sourcing of CORTX

-  Developing new IP/Patents based on R&D

-  Influencing wider research & technology roadmaps in EU (w/ ETP4HPC)

   -  Also gather inputs on R&D areas of value for CORTX & Seagate

**SAGE2 – Vision**
===================


**Vision:**
############



Extending storage systems into Compute nodes & blurring the lines
between memory & storage

*Four primary Innovations Targeted:*

1. **Compute node local Memories**

2. **Byte Addressable extensions** into Persistent storage (Global
   Memory Abstraction)

3. **Co-design**: Mainly Data analytics pipelines w/ AI/Deep learning

4. **Co-design** with arm based environments

**AI/DL use cases expected to be memory intensive & will exploit node
local memory which will need to be extended**

==================================
**MAESTRO [ Sept ‘18 - Aug’21 ]**
==================================


**Summary**
############


-  MAESTRO is a Forchungzentrum Juelich led R&D project for building a
   data aware middleware called “MAESTRO” for extreme scale apps

-  **Seagate Focus:** CORTX support for Maestro and provision of I/O
   functionalities for Maestro


**Partners**
#############


-  Forschungszentrum Juelich(Germany), ECMWF(UK) - hosts the world’s
   largest weather prediction data archives, CSCS(Switzerland) - runs
   the largest supercomputer in the world outside of China, CEA,
   Appentra (Spain)
   
   

**Key Technology Focus**
#########################


MIO - Maestro I/O Interface that sits on top of CORTX-Motr API

-  MIO is a higher level API on top of Motr making it easy to use CORTX

-  MIO work leads to work on a POSIX-lite API in Sage2

-  MIO also has features such as “hints” where users can provide hints
   in data placements



..


================================
**ESiWACE2 [Jan’19 - Dec’22]**
================================



**Summary**
############


-  ESiWACE2 is a **granted** DKRZ led R&D project (ESiWACE1 follow on)
   enabling leading **weather and climate communities** to leverage the
   available performance of pre-Exascale systems with regard to both
   compute and data capacity (Circa 2020) and prepare the weather and
   climate models to make use of Exascale systems when they arrive
   (Circa 2023)

-  **Seagate Focus:** Development of the Motr API/CORTX **suitable for the
   Weather/Climate Community** & provide a prototype storage solution

   Forecast), IT4Innovation (Czech Republic) with a use case from CEITEC
   (Czech Republic), Johannes Gutenberg University (University of Mainz,
   Germany)


**Key Technology Focus**
#########################


-  Ephemeral Services - Services that are allocated on-demand and
   stripped down once the workload/application run ends

-  CORTX Advanced Views - POSIX, HDF5, MPI-IO, CORTX-S3 access - but to the same
   objects ( leverages Lingua Franca)

-  Full in-storage processing - Leverage GPU resources close to storage
   for performing in-storage computations - apart from general purpose
   cores.

-  CORTX+Full HSM - Using a advanced Hierarchical Storage Manager + CORTX
   combination to move data across the full set of storage pools (NVRAM,
   SSD, Flash, Disk, Tape)

\* % Funding Dependent on Brexit Negotiations & if we want to use EU
entities [50% - 100%]
