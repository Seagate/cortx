What is a Hackathon??
======================
Hackathon is an endurance event of the mind and the body, with fantastically brilliant people from all walks of life getting together to create an idea and build it into an awesome product or prototype in an intense and short period of time.

At all hackathons, you will definitely find a mix of developers, data scientists and programmers on board, but it’s not all about the tech whizzes of the world. Entrepreneurs and designers are a massive part of what makes a fantastic product — because it’s not an impactful product if it’s just roboto mono and no way to pitch it.

Skills to attend a Hackathon
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Frankly speaking, no prerequisites are attached to attend a hackathon. Anyways, to make an imprint in the event, it is advisable to have the following skills:

- Logical Reasoning

- Analytical Thinking

- Love for trying new things

- If you are a developer, you become the prerequisite for the seminar and not vice-versa.

Apart from the pointers mentioned above, I guess the most important aspect is the ability to endure something that saps your mind and body.
