What is a Hackathon??
======================
Hackathon is an endurance event of the mind and the body, with fantastically brilliant people from all walks of life getting together to create an idea and build it into an awesome product or prototype in an intense and short period of time.

At all hackathons, you will definitely find a mix of developers, data scientists and programmers on board, but it’s not all about the tech whizzes of the world. Entrepreneurs and designers are a massive part of what makes a fantastic product — because it’s not an impactful product if it’s just roboto mono and no way to pitch it.
