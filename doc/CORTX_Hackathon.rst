What is a Hackathon??
======================
Hackathon is an endurance event of the mind and the body, with fantastically brilliant people from all walks of life getting together to create an idea and build it into an awesome product or prototype in an intense and short period of time.

At all hackathons, you will definitely find a mix of developers, data scientists and programmers on board, but it’s not all about the tech whizzes of the world. Entrepreneurs and designers are a massive part of what makes a fantastic product — because it’s not an impactful product if it’s just roboto mono and no way to pitch it.

Skills to attend a Hackathon
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Frankly speaking, no prerequisites are attached to attend a hackathon. Anyways, to make an imprint in the event, it is advisable to have the following skills:

- Logical Reasoning

- Analytical Thinking

- Love for trying new things

- If you are a developer, you become the prerequisite for the seminar and not vice-versa.

Apart from the pointers mentioned above, I guess the most important aspect is the ability to endure something that saps your mind and body.

Benefits from a Hackathon
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Trust me, you would love to read the following.

- You can end up becoming an innovator. If not, you will witness one that would be encouraging.

  - Hackathons stimulate the creative juices of participants and foster problem-solving and risk-taking in a casual environment. The diversity of participants guarantees a   multitude of perspectives and the time limit on hackathons creates a uniquely productive atmosphere that forces participants to distil their visionary concepts down to actionable solutions.
  
- You would become part of an amazing community.

  - In our technology-centric world, no industry is exempt of unpredictable disruption by technology startups. To stay current and connected to the makers and entrepreneurs that may be leading these overnight sensations, it has become increasingly important for all businesses to engage with and create an innovation community of their own.
  
- You could land a great job.

  - With software developers and data scientists in high demand, it’s challenging for companies to gain exposure, garner interest and determine the best talent. Hackathons address both challenges. Companies gain awareness in the developer community and are perceived as “hacker-friendly”.
  
  
- It is all about IP (Intellectual Property)

  - Hackathons are great, not necessarily because the silver bullet will be found, but because you may find something you never knew. This may be using your software solutions to break into new markets or developing extensions that open up entire new customer bases.
