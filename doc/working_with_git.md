1. Navigate to the repository homepage on GitHub.
2. Click **Fork**
3. Run the following commands in Shell:
   
   `$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Seagate/<repository>.git`

4. You'll need to setup the upstream repository in the remote list. This is a one-time activity. Run the following command to view the configured remote repository for your fork.
    
   `$ git remote -v`  

    **Sample Output:**
    
    ```shell
    
     origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     ```

 5. Set up the upstream repository in the remote list using:
   
    `$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seagate/<repository>.git`
      
    `$ git remote -v`

     **Sample Output:**
    
     ```shell
    
     origin git@github.com:<gitgub-id>/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (fetch)
     upstream git@github.com:Seagate/cortx-sspl.git (push)
     ```
    
6. Check out to your branch using:

   `$ git checkout "branchname"`

   `$ git checkout -b 'your-local-branch-name`
   
    :page_with_curl: **Note:** By default, you'll need to contribute to the main branch.
