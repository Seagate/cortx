### GitHub setup

#### Generate SSH key on your development box (Needed if you wish to use SSH for clone)
> $ $ ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "seagate-email-address"

#### Add SSH key to GitHub Account
 1. Copy public key i.e. id_rsa.pub (default location: /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
 2. Go to GitHub SSH key settings: https://github.com/settings/keys of your account
 3. Check if your GitHub-id is associated with Seagate email address as Primary email else SSO will not work.
 4. Add the new SSH key and then select Enable SSO option and Authorize for this key. 

#### Token (personal access) for command line (Required for submodule clone process)
 - Create a personal access token and use it in place of a password when performing Git operations over HTTPS with Git on the command line or the API.
 - A personal access token is required to authenticate to GitHub in the following situations:
   - When you're using two-factor authentication
   - To access protected content in an organization that uses SAML single sign-on (SSO). Tokens used with organizations that use SAML SSO must be authorized.
   - Reference Article, [Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
   - In this new token, please make sure that to **Enable SSO**.
 - The access required for the personal token is as follows:
   - [x] repo
     - [x] repo:status
     - [x] repo_deployment
     - [x] public_repo
     - [x] repo:invite
     - [x] security_events

### Git setup on development box
1. Update Git to the latest version
    - with older git version, you might be getting errors with commit hook, like this one:

   > $ git commit
   > git: 'interpret-trailers' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
cannot insert change-id line in .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG

   Fix (for CentOS 7.x):

      > $ yum remove git

      > $ yum -y install  https://packages.endpoint.com/rhel/7/os/x86_64/endpoint-repo-1.7-1.x86_64.rpm

      > $ yum -y install git
  
2. Install git-clang-format

   > $ yum install git-clang-format

3. Setup the git config options

    > $ git config --global user.name ‘Your Name’

    > $ git config --global user.email ‘Your.Name@seagate.com’

    > $ git config --global color.ui auto

    > $ git config --global credential.helper cache (Required for submodule clone process)
 
### To work on a feature and submit review to GitHub

#### Clone cortx-s3server
- Each contributor needs to do 'fork' to create their own private cortx-s3server repository.
   - Go to homepage of 'cortx-s3server' repository on GitHub, there you will see 'fork' at top right corner.

   > $ git clone git@github.com:"your-github-id"/cortx-s3server.git
 
- Ensure you have checked out “main” branch

   > $ git checkout main

   > $ git checkout -b 'your-local-branch-name'

- Make code changes

- Add files to be pushed to git to staged area

   > $ git add foo/somefile.cc

- Add all such files

- Now commit your changes

   > $ git commit -m ‘GID - Appropriate Feature/Change Description’

- Check git log to see your commit, verify the author name

   > $ git log 

- If author name is not set properly then set using following command

- Push your changes to GitHub
   > $ git push origin 'your-local-branch-name'
