CORTX Monthly 'Meet an Architect' Series
#######

On the first Thursday of every month at GMT 1600, the CORTX Community hosts a 'Meet an Architect' meeting in which 
a CORTX architect, or community member, presents a presentation of interest for the community and
in which time is left for a question and answer session.

The Meet an Architect series are open to the public. You can subscribe via this `Calendar`_ invite. In addition, for those who cannot join us live, all meetings are recorded and made available on this page afterwards. 

.. _Calendar: https://cortx.link/mma_invite
