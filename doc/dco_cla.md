## CORTX Community DCO and CLA policy

To ensure contributions can be redistributed by all under an open source license, 
all contributions must be signed with [DCO](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/cla-vs-dco-whats-difference).

You can pass DCO in many ways:

- While creating a Pull Request via the GitHub UI, add `Signed-off-by: "Name" <email address>` in the PR comments section. 

   **Example:** `Signed-off-by: John Doe <John.doe@gmail.com>`

- DCO will automatically pass if you push commits using [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/configuring-git-for-github-desktop). 

- You can also pass DCO by adding a Signed-off-by line to commit messages in Git CLI:

   `Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>`
   
    Git even has a `-s` command line option to append this automatically to your commit message:

   `$ git commit -s -m` - here -m is your commit message.

To further ensure that all members of the community can redistribute and resell CORTX should and when they so choose, 
[CLA](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/cla-vs-dco-whats-difference) may be 
required on a case-by-case basis such that corporations cannot attempt to prevent others from reselling CORTX.  

More formally, in order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions 
from any person or entity, CORTX Community may require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on 
file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This 
license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the project and its users; 
it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. 

The code reviewers will use the following decision tree to determine when CLA will be needed:
