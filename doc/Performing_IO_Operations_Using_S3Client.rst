You need to install the S3 client to perform the IO operations in the CORTX. The AWS CLI can either installed on the same VM or the different VM.

For more information on:

-  Sample code for doing S3 IO operations, see `CORTX Sample S3 Code </cortx-s3samplecode>`__.
-  To use CyberDuck for IO operations, see `CyberDuck for IO Operations <CyberDuckIO.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the same OVA, see `AWS CLI on the CORTX OVA VM <aws_cli_on_same_vm.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the new VM, see `AWS CLI on a different VM <aws_on_separate_vm.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on Windows, see  `AWS CLI on Windows <aws_cli_on_windows_mc.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the same OVA with K8s(OVA-2.0.0-585 onward), see `AWS CLI on K8s architecture  <ova/2.0.0/PI-5/S3_IO_Operations.md>`__.
