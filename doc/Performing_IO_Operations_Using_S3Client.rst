You need to install the S3 client to perform the IO operations in the CORTX. The AWS CLI can either installed on the same VM or the different VM.

-  To use CyberDuck for IO operations, see `CyberDuck for IO Operations <CyberDuckIO.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the same OVA, see `AWS CLI on the CORTX OVA VM <aws_cli_on_same_vm.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the new VM, see `AWS CLI on a different VM <aws_on_separate_vm.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on Windows, see  `AWS CLI on Windows <aws_cli_on_windows_mc.md>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the same OVA with K8s(OVA-2.0.0-585 onward), see `AWS CLI on K8s architecture  <ova/2.0.0/PI-5/S3_IO_Operations.md>`__.
