========================================
Performing IO Operations Using S3 Client
========================================

If you want to use the provided OVA to test CORTX and observe activity in its GUI, you should have already followed the `instructions <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/OVA/1.0.4/CORTX_on_Open_Virtual_Appliance.rst>`_ to install and configure the OVA.  If you have not yet done so, please do that before following the rest of the instructions on this page.

To perform the IO operations in CORTX, you need to install the AWS CLI. You can install the AWS CLI either on the same OVA or you can create a new VM and install it.

For more information on:

-  To use CyberDuck for IO operations, see `CyberDuck for IO Operations <#CyberDuck-for-IO-Operations>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the same OVA, see `AWS CLI on the CORTX OVA VM <#AWS-CLI-on-the-CORTX-OVA-VM>`__.
-  AWS CLI on the new VM, see `AWS CLI on a different VM <#AWS-CLI-on-a-different-VM>`__.

Prerequisites
=============

- Verify that the S3 server endpoint is reachable using the following command:

        ::
    
            ping <s3 endpoint or public data IP>

    - If yes then go ahead and configure the s3 client. 
    - If not then recheck the client VM network configuration.  See `Troubleshoot Virtual Network </doc/troubleshoot_virtual_network.rst>`__.

- If you are using AWS CLI for operation then install the unzip package:

    ::
        
        yum install unzip -y


CyberDuck for IO Operations
============================

You can install the CyberDuck on the CORTX OVA to perform IO operations.

   <summary><a>Click here to expand the instructions.</a></summary>

#. Ensure that all the prerequisites are satisfied. See `Prerequisites <#Prerequisites>`__.

#. If you do not already have one, download an S3 client.  These instructions use `CyberDuck <https://cyberduck.io/download/>`_.

#. If you have not already created an S3 user, then navigate to you your CORTX GUI, select 'Manage', then select the 'S3 Account' tab, then click on 'Add new account.'

   .. image:: images/add_s3_user.png
   
#. After adding the new account, make sure to copy the 'Access Key' and the 'Secret Key'.  Note that they will also be available in the CSV which is downloaded when you add the new account.

#. Return to your S3 client, and open a connection using the data IP you determined when you `installed and configured CORTX <CORTX_on_Open_Virtual_Appliance.rst>`_, and the access key and the secret key you recorded in the previous step.  Make sure also to set the protocol to 'Amazon S3'.  Here is how it looks in CyberDuck:

   .. image:: images/open_cyberduck_connection.png
   
   * If you see a Certificate error when you open the connection, you can ignore this error.  To suppress this error, you can add an SSL certificate in the Settings tab of the CORTX GUI.

#. After opening the connection in CyberDuck, create a new folder and then upload a large file into that folder.

#. Navigate to the Dashboard tab in your CORTX GUI, change 'Metric 1' to 'throughput_write' and you should see activity in the dashboard as so:

AWS CLI on the CORTX OVA VM
===========================

You can install the AWS CLI on the CORTX OVA to perform IO operations. 

.. raw:: html

    <details>
   <summary><a>Click here to expand the instructions.</a></summary>
    
#. Ensure that all the prerequisites are satisfied. See `Prerequisites <#Prerequisites>`__.

#. Install and configure the the AWS CLI Client. See `AWS CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html>`__.

#. To create an S3 user account:
    
    1. On the CORTX GUI, go to the **Manage > S3 Account > Add New Account**.
    
        .. image:: images/add_s3_user.png
    
    2. Enter the required details and click **Create**

#. After the new account is created, make sure to copy the *Access Key* and the *Secret Key*. The Access Key and Screte Key will also be available in the CSV file which is downloaded when you add the new account.

#. Create a bucket on CORTX GUI:
   
    1. Log-in to CORTX GUI  using S3 account credentials at https://<management IP>:28100/#/
    
    2. Go to the **Manage tab > Bucket > Create Bucket**.
    
    3. Enter the Bucket name and click **Create**.

        .. image:: images/Create-Bucket.png

#. Configure AWS credentials using following commands:
    
    1. Run the following command to configure the AWS configure: 
    
        ::
           
            aws configure

        .. image::  images/aws-configure.png

    2. Set the endpoint URL:
        
        ::

            aws configure set s3.endpoint_url https://s3.seagate.com

    3. Set the API endpoint URL: 
            
        ::
        
            aws configure set s3api.endpoint_url https://s3.seagate.com

    4. Set the AWS certificate path:
   
        ::
        
            aws configure set default.ca_bundle /opt/seagate/cortx/provisioner/srv/components/s3clients/files/ca.crt

#. Perform IO operation:

        ::
        
            aws s3 ls --endpoint-url=http://s3.seagate.com

        .. image::  images/verify-bkt.png
