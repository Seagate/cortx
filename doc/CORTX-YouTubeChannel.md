### CORTX - Intelligent Object Storage Software

The rising flood of unstructured data which includes video, audio, medical imagery, analytics, and sensor data is beginning to overwhelm the world's ability to manage 
and monetize precious data. Only a fraction of the data created will be stored and a vast majority of it and the potential value it holds will be lost to humanity. Introducing CORTX, our object storage software solution delivers intelligence and massive scalability to tame the flood.

### Intel and Seagate Deliver Next-Gen Complete Data Center Storage Platforms
    
The DAOS team at Intel has been given what at one time would have seemed like a strange goal: high-performance object storage for NVRAM storage media.
Using their roots in high-performance computing, DAOS has delivered as is evidenced by their current #1 ranking in the IO500 benchmark. 
In this session, DAOS architect Johann Lombardi chats with Seagate architect Nikita Danilov as they explore the further question of how to wed DAOS with 
the mass-capacity storage devices that all data centers will need for economically-efficient storage of massive data sets.

### Connecting CORTX to Splunk

Our Developer Advocate, Justin Woo, walks us through integrating Splunk and CORTX. Splunk is a software platform that allows you to search, monitor, 
and analyze machine-generated big data via a web-style interface. Because CORTX is S3 compatible we can use the storage system and the Splunk SmartStore feature 
to offload data to the object storage. This short video walks through an integration a CORTX integration with Splunk.
