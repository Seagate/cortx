Configuring the CORTX GUI
==========================

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure the CORTX GUI. You can configure the CORTX GUI after your CORTX cluster is up and running using one of the following guides:

- `Any CORTX Open Virtual Appliance guide <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/tree/main/doc/ova>`_
- `Building the CORTX Environment for Single Node <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/community-build/Building-CORTX-From-Source-for-SingleNode.md>`_

The configuration of CORTX GUI gets completed in two-step:

- `Preboarding <#Preboarding>`_
- `Onboarding <#Onboarding>`_

Preboarding
===========

The preboarding procedure must be performed only once. On the preboarding process, you need to create an admin user for CORTX GUI.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the *https://<management IP>/#/preboarding/welcome*

   - If you see a message about your connection not being private, it is safe to ignore this message.
   - If you are using Google Chrome, you may proceed by simply typing the following text (click on anywhere)

     ``thisisunsafe``

 **Note:** For 1.0.4 OVA use, Open a browser and navigate to the https://<management IP>:28100/#/preboarding/welcome

2. Click **Start**. A page that requests you to accept the End User License Agreement (EULA) appears.

Onboarding
===========

The onboarding procedure must be performed after completing the preboarding procedure. You should be brought automatically to the correct page after completing the preboarding:

- If you are not or you want to redo the onboarding, navigate to *https://<management IP>/#/onboarding*
- If you logged out navigate to: *https://<management IP>/#/preboarding/login*

You can also perform the onboarding tasks from the **Settings** page.

#. Enter information about the **DNS servers** and **Search domains** in relevant fields, and click **Continue**.
   Multiple entries must be separated by commas.

   - If you don't know your DNS servers, refer `nameserver` by running `dig` command.

   - If you don't know your search domains, please use cortx.test.

#. Enter the NTP server address in the text box and select the NTP time zone offset from the drop-down menu. Then, click **Continue**.
   Multiple entries must be separated by a comma.

   - If you don't know your NTP server, ntp-b.nist.gov will usually work. To use another NTP server, visit `https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi <https://tf.nist.gov/tf-cgi/servers.cgi>`_

   #. Fill in the fields appropriately.

   #. After filling in the information in all the fields, click **Send test mail**. If configured correctly, you should receive a test mail from CORTX.
