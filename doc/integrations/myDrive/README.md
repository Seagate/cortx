## Cortx-MyDrive is a free Open Source Cloud Server (Similar To Google Drive) integrated with CORTX engine

Notice ‚ù§: this integration is heavily based on [cortx-js-sdk](https://github.com/kaminskypavel/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/cortx-js-sdk
), for more info click on the image below, which I also implemented as part of this integration, but published as a different integration 
for making the life of future developers easier.

## Problem

In this day and age, privacy and "owning" your own information - matters!
Enterprises may choose a self hosted solutions for a well known software , and some  might go as far as hosting their own servers and infrastructure.

## Solution

We provide a self hosted solution for a remote data drive similar to "Google Drive" and "Dropbox",
which can be useful both on an enterprise and a personal level

## Technology 

- The project is base on the popular open source project [myDrive](https://mydrive-storage.com/) who received over 2000+ stars.
