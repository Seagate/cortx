### Change the way the world does by connecting CORTX™— Seagate’s open-source object storage software — with the tools and platforms that underpin the data revolution.

Storing and managing data had never been easy and with flourish of AI, deep learning we have generated paramounts of data called Big Data.

<pre>
The ideal big data storage system would allow storage of a virtually unlimited amount of data, cope both with high rates of random write and read access, flexibly and efficiently deal with a range of different data models, support both structured and unstructured data, and for privacy reasons, only work on encrypted data. Obviously, all these needs cannot be fully satisfied.

## Background / Overview of the project

## The Problem

### What we want to solve?

The problem statement is from my personal story, I was working on a wildlife conservation project to save animals from poaching and using biometric sensors to monitor body vitals, with tremendous hardwork I collected enough amount of data, not an easy task- I had to daily meet park rangers to get data but my negligence ruined all my hardwork after fatal HDD crash. Such huge loss in terms of data and time, the project could not be completed yet, due to it. But this time I will ensure that the data generated by the data revolution can be harnessed to the full extent of its potential using CORTX S3 data services which are scalable, reliable and efficient.

### Hypothesis
Integrating Label Studio, an open source data annotation tool widely used by global AI brands. Integrating, S3 services for result storing and data retrieval for data analytics and other data related tasks. Label Studio is compatible with cloud services in it's latest version, so it is good and compatible to integrate Cortx S3 with it.

<b> What is CORTX? CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for great efficiency, massive capacity, and high HDD-utilization. CORTX is 100% Open Source. </b>

## What our integration does?

Our integration is simple, it allows you to import bulk data from your S3 bucket and once you are with data annotations, you can export it in most widely used annotation formats: JSON, CSV, COCO, PASCAL VOC. Moreover, you can also download the exported data inany Machine Learning environment using these codes.

### Why this integration is important?

Building an AI or ML model that acts like a human requires large volumes of training data. For a model to make decisions and take action, it must be trained to understand specific information. Data annotation is the categorization and labeling of data for AI applications. However, no sole company relies upon one AI dataset or model for it's long term operation, it uses tons of those data in variey of usecases. In order to have a connected system where data annotations and data is stored requires massive scalability and efficiency, completely open source too. With our integration, new startups and AI companeis and store and fetch huge loads of big data from Cortx S3, from making self-driving cars, nano surgical bots and Mars Rovers, all require it.

## Integration walkthrough

Step 1: Download reuirements
- We are integrating S3 storage on label Studio, open source annotation tool, download it using `pip` command:
<pre>
 $ pip install -U label-studio
</pre>
- Start the label studio to verify installation, it would run on local host
<pre>
 $ label-studio 
</pre>

Step 2: CORTX Cloudshare VM lab setup
- Once the Cortex VM is ready, run this command
<pre>
 $ sudo route add default gw 192.168.2.1 ens33

</pre>
- Start Windows Server 2019 Edition, go to this S3 cortex dashboard, by default S3 user and test bucket is already made for you
