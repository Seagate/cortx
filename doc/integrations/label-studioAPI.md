### Change the way the world does by connecting CORTX™— Seagate’s open-source object storage software — with the tools and platforms that underpin the data revolution.

Storing and managing data had never been easy and with flourish of AI, deep learning we have generated paramounts of data called Big Data.

<pre>
The ideal big data storage system would allow storage of a virtually unlimited amount of data, cope both with high rates of random write and read access, flexibly and efficiently deal with a range of different data models, support both structured and unstructured data, and for privacy reasons, only work on encrypted data. Obviously, all these needs cannot be fully satisfied.

## Background / Overview of the project
<img src="https://github.com/vilaksh01/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/label-studioAPI/Images/page3.jpg">

A need for scalable, efficient storage service for ever growing unstructured data due to massive adoption of AI.
Building Seagate Cortex S3 storage solutions INTEGRATIONS to store and automate, one of the most complex task in AI, data annotations.
Building user interface to make annotation exports and project tracking simpler.

### The Problem
<b> What we want to solve? </b>

The problem statement is from my personal story, I was working on a wildlife conservation project to save animals from poaching and using biometric sensors to monitor body vitals, with tremendous hardwork I collected enough amount of data, not an easy task- I had to daily meet park rangers to get data but my negligence ruined all my hardwork after fatal HDD crash. Such huge loss in terms of data and time, the project could not be completed yet, due to it. But this time I will ensure that the data generated by the data revolution can be harnessed to the full extent of its potential using CORTX S3 data services.

### Hypothesis
Integrating Label Studio, an open source data annotation tool widely used by global AI brands. Integrating, S3 services for result storing and data retrieval for data analytics and other data related tasks. Label Studio is compatible with cloud services in it's latest version, so it is good and compatible to integrate Cortx S3 with it.
