### Integrating Cortx and PyTorch

#### PyTorch
(PyTorch-link) is an open source deep learning framework, that provides graph-based execution, distributed training, mobile deployment, quantization, developing neural network models.

Deep learning models require sufficient amount of data to be more efficient. For example, If you are dealing with image dataset, storing this data may sometimes become expensive
