CORTX Integrations

As an S3 compatible object storage system, CORTX is designed to integrate easily with many other technologies.  Additionally, with its unique motr interface, custom applications
such as those using the KV API or the File Data Manipulation Interface (FDMI) plugin system are also possible. Please refer to the Motr documentation `here <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/doc/reading-list.md#motr-clients>`_ for more information.
