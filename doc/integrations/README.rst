##################

As an S3 compatible object storage system, CORTX is designed to integrate easily with many other technologies.  Additionally, with its unique motr interface, custom applications
such as those using the KV API or the FDMI plugin system are also possible (please refer `here <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx-motr/blob/main/doc/reading-list.md#motr-clients>`_ for more information).

The following list of pages show how to integrate CORTX with a variety of other technologies:
