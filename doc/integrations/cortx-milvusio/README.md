# Cortx Object Storage Integration with Milvus.io
### Store, index, manage and search trillions of document vectors in milliseconds. Build neural search applications for your unstructured data with Milvus.io and Cortx Object Storage system.

## Inspiration
Neural search, which combines machine learning and object storage technologies, could one day enable people to access the entire world’s information. They would be able to search through any data that is available online but not stored in a standard database format like text or images. This includes newspaper articles from 80 years ago or **genetic sequence records** – anything! Since so much of the world’s knowledge exists outside of normal databases already today, neural applications will likely play an important role in research as well as everyday tasks soon enough.

## What it does
Milvus was created in 2019 with a singular goal: to store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.

As a database specifically designed to handle queries over input vectors, it is capable of indexing vectors on a trillion scale. Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data. Unstructured data, including images, video, audio, and natural language, is information that doesn't follow a predefined model or manner of organization. This data type accounts for ~80% of the world's data and can be converted into vectors using various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models.
