# Cortx Object Storage Integration with Milvus.io
### Store, index, manage and search trillions of document vectors in milliseconds. Build neural search applications for your unstructured data with Milvus.io and Cortx Object Storage system.

## Inspiration
Neural search, which combines machine learning and object storage technologies, could one day enable people to access the entire world’s information. They would be able to search through any data that is available online but not stored in a standard database format like text or images. This includes newspaper **articles** from 80 years ago or **genetic sequence records** – anything! Since so much of the world’s knowledge exists outside of normal databases already today, neural applications will likely play an important role in research as well as everyday tasks soon enough.

## What it does
Milvus was created in 2019 with a singular goal: to store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.

As a database specifically designed to handle queries over input vectors, it is capable of indexing vectors on a trillion scale. Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data. Unstructured data, including images, video, audio, and natural language, is information that doesn't follow a predefined model or manner of organization. This data type accounts for ~80% of the world's data and can be converted into vectors using various artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models.

**Cortx Object storage stores snapshot files of logs, index files for scalar and vector data, and intermediate query results, and is responsible for data persistence of large files in the cluster, such as index and binary log files.**

## Cortx as the Milvus Object Storage
 Here we will learn about the implementation of data insertion, index building, and data query in Milvus with Cortx as Object Storage Backend.

The above diagram encapsulates four components involved in the process of writing log sequence: proxy, log broker, data node, and object storage. The process involves four tasks: validation of DML requests, publication-subscription of log sequence, conversion from streaming log to log snapshots, and persistence of log snapshots. The four tasks are decoupled from each other to make sure each task is handled by its corresponding node type.

Index building mainly involves vector and matrix operations and hence is computation- and memory-intensive. As shown above, Milvus supports building index for each vector field, scalar field and primary field. Both the input and output of index building engage with object storage: The index node loads the log snapshots to index from a segment (which is in object storage) to memory, deserializes the corresponding data and metadata to build index, serializes the index when index building completes, and writes it back to object storage.

As shown above, Data query refers to the process of searching a specified collection for k number of vectors nearest to a target vector or for all vectors within a specified distance range to the vector. From the Index Building step, we learned that a collection in Milvus is split into multiple segments, and the query nodes load indexes by segment. **When a search request arrives, it is broadcast to all query nodes for a concurrent search. Each node then prunes the local segments, searches for vectors meeting the criteria, and reduces and returns the search results.**

So we see that Milvus uses logs as the data, mechanism throughout all processes for inter-data exchange between all Milvus components.
