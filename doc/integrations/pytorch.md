**What is ParlAI?**
ParlAI is a python-based platform for enabling dialog AI research.

Its goal is to provide researchers:

  * a unified framework for sharing, training and testing dialog models

  *  many popular datasets available all in one place, with the ability to multi-task over them

  * seamless integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection and human evaluation

  * integration with chat services like Facebook Messenger to connect agents with humans in a chat interface
