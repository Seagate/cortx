Step 2 - CORTX Connection
#########################
    

CORTX Server
************

`CORTX <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx>`__ is an Open Source Object Storage,
uniquely optimized for mass capacity and compatible with AWS S3 API.

-  Make sure you have an existing CORTX server running
-  You can also refer to https://github.com/Seagate/cortx for step by step guidance
   on installation

You must first setup the following environment variables with the
credentials of your CORTX server.

.. code-block:: console

    $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR-CORTX-ACCESS-KEY-ID>
    $ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= <YOUR-CORTX-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY>

Now you can easily initialize restic to use CORTX server as a backend with
this command.

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./restic -r s3:<YOUR-CORTX-ENDPOINT-URL>/<BUCKET-NAME> init
    enter password for new repository:
    enter password again:
    created restic repository 6ad29560f5 at s3:<YOUR-CORTX-ENDPOINT-URL>/<BUCKET-NAME>
    Please note that knowledge of your password is required to access
    the repository. Losing your password means that your data is irrecoverably lost.

Step 3 - Backing Up
###################


You can even backup individual files in the same repository (not passing
``--verbose`` means less output):

.. code-block:: console

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo backup ~/work.txt
    enter password for repository:
    password is correct
    snapshot 249d0210 saved

If you're interested in what restic does, pass ``--verbose`` twice (or
``--verbose=2``) to display detailed information about each file and directory
restic encounters:

.. code-block:: console

    $ echo 'more data foo bar' >> ~/work.txt

    $ restic -r /srv/restic-repo backup --verbose --verbose ~/work.txt
    open repository
    enter password for repository:
    password is correct
    lock repository
    load index files
    using parent snapshot f3f8d56b
    start scan
    start backup
    scan finished in 2.115s
    modified  /home/user/work.txt, saved in 0.007s (22 B added)
    modified  /home/user/, saved in 0.008s (0 B added, 378 B metadata)
    modified  /home/, saved in 0.009s (0 B added, 375 B metadata)
    processed 22 B in 0:02
    Files:           0 new,     1 changed,     0 unmodified
    Dirs:            0 new,     2 changed,     0 unmodified
    Data Blobs:      1 new
    Tree Blobs:      3 new
    Added:      1.116 KiB
    snapshot 8dc503fc saved

In fact several hosts may use the same repository to backup directories
and files leading to a greater de-duplication.

Now is a good time to run ``restic check`` to verify that all data
is properly stored in the repository. You should run this command regularly
to make sure the internal structure of the repository is free of errors.
