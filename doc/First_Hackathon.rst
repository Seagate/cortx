The theme of this hackathon was integrations.  Participants were asked to connect various other data analysis technologies with CORTX using our S3 interface in order to demonstrate the suitability of CORTX across a wide range of different use cases.  The hackathon resulted in the following integrations:

- `FHIR <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/fhir.md>`_ 
- `Images API <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/images-api.md>`_ 
- `Tensorflow <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/tensorflow>`_ 
- `Prometheus <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/prometheus.md>`_
- `Siddhi <https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/siddhi-celery.md>`_
