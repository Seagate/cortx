CI/CD and other Automation
==========================

Codacy
------
CORTX is currently integrated with [Codacy](http://codacy.com) for automated static code analysis of both our Motr and S3 submodules.
When you go to Codacy, you must first log-in using your GitHub credentials.  The Codacy report for Motr can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/cortx-motr/dashboard).  The Codacy report for S3 can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/cortx-s3server/dashboard).  And, finally, the Codacy report for this parent repository can be found [here](https://app.codacy.com/gh/Seagate/cortx/dashboard).

TODO

Add more automation and document them here.
