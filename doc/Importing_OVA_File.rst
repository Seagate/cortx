#. Find the line <vssd:VirtualSystemType>vmx-##</vssd:VirtualSystemType> and change the vmx-## value.

   - Change vmx-10 to vmx-09, or to a different hw version that works with ESXi.
   
#. Save the changes and close the file.

#. Calculate the SHA-1 hash of the .ovf file and replace the hash value in the .mf file.
