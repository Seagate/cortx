# Create a new VM from scratch
For CORTX development, you can create a new VM from scatch and then install a fresh CentOS 7.8.2003.

## 1. Download ISO file
You can download CentOS 7.8.2003 ISO file from http://www.centos.org, or from any mirror site you like.

## 2. Create a new VM in your VM provider (VMWare Fusion, or Oracle VirtualBox)
* At least two CPUs or cores.
* At least 4GB of memories.
* At least 40GB of disk.
* Two network adapters. One is local only, and another is NAT.

## 3. Install a fresh CentOS 7.8.2003
Automatic install or manual install. Basic installation is OK. When you build CORTX from source in next steps, dependant packages will be resolved and installed.

## 4. Run the following commands.

$ sudo yum install epel-release

$ sudo yum repolist

$ sudo yum install ansible

$ wget https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/epel/5/x86_64/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
$ sudo rpm â€“ivh epel-release-latest-5.noarch.rpm
$ sudo yum repolist
$ sudo yum install ansible

## 5. Now you are ready to build and test CORTX.
