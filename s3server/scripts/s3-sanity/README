###

These scripts assume that S3 server and necessary s3 domain is setup and these
scripts are expected to run on S3 client nodes.

It also assumes that s3cmd is setup properly on the node where these are run.
Minimally s3cmd .s3cfg should be pointing to correct Seagate S3 services:

# Sample from ~/.s3cfg
```
host_base = s3.seagate.com
host_bucket = %(bucket)s.s3.seagate.com
```

### Run S3 tests
```
# For simple tests
./s3-sanity-test.sh

# For regression tests for different object sizes
./s3-obj-reg-test.sh

# For regression tests for different object sizes with s3fs
./s3fs-obj-reg-test.sh
```
