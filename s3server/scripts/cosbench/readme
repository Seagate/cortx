cosbench automation scripts are used to

1) Install/configure/start/stop cosbench on controller node and driver nodes
2) Create s3 setup related file, which will be used as input for other actions
3) Create and execute workload
4) Manage running workloads (listing/cancelling)

Cosbench setup:

  --Installing cosbench on controller and driver nodes:
    sh cosbench.sh install --controller <controller-ip> --drivers <path to driver-nodes.list file>

  --Configuring cosbench
    sh cosbench.sh configure --controller <controller-ip> --drivers <path to driver-nodes.list file>

  --Starting cosbench on controller and driver nodes
    sh cosbench.sh start --controller <controller-ip> --drivers <path to driver-nodes.list file>

  --Stopping cosbench on controller and driver nodes
    sh cosbench.sh stop --controller <controller-ip> --drivers <path to driver-nodes.list file>


  driver-nodes.list must contain list of all driver nodes. One line per driver, each line containing
  driver's IP or its node name

Workload Creation/Management:

  --First create s3 setup file, it will contain s3server credentials and s3 endpoint

    For example:
    sh configure.sh
    Enter the label for S3 setup:s3setup
    S3 endpoint url: https://s3.seagate.com
    Access Key: wk2fXspKR1iNNy3GAiG6Ew
    Secret Key:  8dgXIM+ouFYtv1ELApIO+hDHYfWOxhNRxj0hIf7Y

    Above script execution will create file s3setup.properties file which will contain s3 credentials
    and s3 endpoint. This s3setup.propertied file will be used for various other actions

  --Creation and Execution of Workload:

    Workload can be created and executed in interactive and non-interactive mode

    Interactive mode:

      The interactive mode will prompt user for various workload properties,
      the properties value will be made use in creation of workload file.

      sh run-test.sh --s3setup <s3setup.properties file created above> --controller <controller-ip>
          --interactive

    Non interactive mode:

      In non interactive mode we need to create a file which will contain various
      workload properties and its value.

      Example:
      [root@s3dev cosbench]# cat workload.properties
      no_of_buckets=2
      no_of_objects=6
      object_size_in_mb=1
      no_of_workers=2
      workload_type=all
      run_time_in_seconds=180

      no_of_bucket -- Number of buckets that will be created
      no_of_objects -- Number of objects that will be created
      object_size_in_mb -- Objects size in MB
      no_of_workers -- Number of worker threads
      workload_type -- workload type, Supported workload types are 'read', 'write', 'mixed' and 'all'
                      'read' means 100% read only, 'write' means 100 write only, 'mixed' means
                      read to write ratio will be 50:50, 25:75 and 75:25, 'all' workload type means
                      it includes all (ie read,write and mixed)


      sh run-test.sh --s3setup <s3setup.properties file created above> --controller <controller-ip>
         --workload <workload.properties file>


   Sucessful creation and execution of workload by run-test.sh will result in the generation of workload ID

 --Management of running workload:

   All running workloads can be listed and be canceled.

   listing of active workloads:
     sh manage-workload-status.sh --list_running  --controller <controller-ip>

   Above script will list workload IDs of all running workload

   Cancellation of running worload:
     sh manage-workload-status.sh --cancel <workload ID>


 --Capturing of performance metric to local directory:

   After execution of workload, its corresponding performance mertic can be collected

   sh capture-artifacts.sh --workloadID <workload ID> --output-directory <local directory to copy output file>
         --controller <controller-ip>
