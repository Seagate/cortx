For S3 load balancing we use haporxy and the load balancer nodes' HA is
managed using LVS Virtual IP and keepalived.

Typical setup with 2 haproxy nodes and exposed via a single VIP (Virtual IP).
VIP assignment is managed with keepalived.

Setup:
- Assuming 2 nodes, haproxy1 and haproxy2

- yum install haproxy keepalived

- Based on OS version add the haproxy configs ie scripts/haproxy/haproxy_osver7.cfg or haproxy_osver8.cfg.
  See <s3 src>/README.md

- On node 1 (haproxy1) copy the keepalived.conf.master to /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

- On node 2 (haproxy2) copy the keepalived.conf.backup to /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf

- Update the /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf on each node to use the VIP in your setup.

- start keepalived on both nodes (haproxy1 and haproxy2)
  systemctl start keepalived

- Check VIP assignment by using `ip a` command, master node (haproxy1) should have VIP
  activated and backup node (haproxy2) should not have VIP in `ip a` output.

- Test VIP : haproxy_port reachability from a client node.

For failover test, stop either haproxy service on node 1 (haproxy1) or simply
stop haproxy1 node and verify that node 2(haproxy2) should now have the VIP enabled
by running "ip a" command.
