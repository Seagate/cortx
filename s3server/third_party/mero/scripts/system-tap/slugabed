#
# This script measures time spent by a process is system calls.
#
# Usage:
#
#     slugabed PATH_TO_BINARY
#
# The script doesn't start the process. The process can be started after or
# before the script.
#
# Script terminates when the process completes or when the script is
# interrupted. The output is a sequence of entries, like the following:
#
#     sum: 204029800 min: 11 max: 129181 avg: 4980 num: 40964
#     process("/m/utils/.libs/lt-ut").syscall.return
#     __lll_lock_wait+0x24 [libpthread-2.12.so]
#     _L_lock_854+0xf [libpthread-2.12.so]
#     __pthread_mutex_lock+0x37 [libpthread-2.12.so]
#     m0_mutex_lock+0x5b [libmero-0.1.0.so]
#     nlx_tm_ev_worker+0x48f [lt-ut]
#     m0_thread_trampoline+0xc1 [libmero-0.1.0.so]
#     uthread_trampoline+0x37 [libmero-0.1.0.so]
#     start_thread+0xd1 [libpthread-2.12.so]
#     __clone+0x6d [libc-2.12.so]
#
# Each entry is the header line followed by the probe name, followed by the
# backtrace. The header line summarises the time spent in a system call entered
# from the given backtrace:
#
#     sum: the total time in microseconds,
#     min: the minimal system call time,
#     max: the maximal system call time,
#     avg: the average time,
#     num: a number of times the kernel was entered from this backtrace.
#
# The output is sorted in the decreasing "sum" order.
#
# System call entries are followed by profiler entries of the form
#
#     hits: 7
#     __fsnotify_parent+0x1 [kernel]
#     vfs_read+0x107 [kernel]
#     sys_pread64+0x82 [kernel]
#     tracesys+0xd9 [kernel]
#     __pread_nocancel+0x2a [libpthread-2.12.so]
#     __os_io+0x37b [libdb-4.8.so]
#     __memp_pgread+0x77 [libdb-4.8.so]
#     __memp_fget+0x1cbd [libdb-4.8.so]

#     m0_table_lookup+0x93 [libmero-0.1.0.so]
#
# Which indicate how many times a particular kernel+user stack was observed from
# a periodic timer interrupt.
#
# Caveats:
#
# The script needs kernel debugging symbols (does it?).
#
# The process should not fork.
#
# There should be a single running process matching the command line argument.
#
# The script introduces significant overhead. E.g., the total mero UT time
# increases by 30%.
#
# Sometimes the script is aborted due to excessive probe cycle count. Backtrace
# is expensive. Test newer systap versions.
#
# The "end" probe is often aborted, because it is too long. This is why the
# output is restricted to the top 1000 entries.

# MAXTRACE=10        reduces the depth of collected backtraces to 10 to make
#                    ubacktrace() faster.
#
# STP_NO_OVERLOAD    disables aborting script on running out of cycle limit.
#
# MAXSKIPPED=1000000 some probes are skipped, because of delays, don't abort the
#                    script due to this.
#
# MAXERRORS=1000     ignores some spurious utrace errors.
