This document contains a list of small code-level tasks that require no further
design. The intention is that people take tasks from the list to avoid being
blocked. Synchronization of concurrent list updates is through email. Task is
moved into IN-PROGRESS section after someone has started working on it.
Completed tasks are moved into DONE section. The list is populated by team and
sub-team leads, contact them to add more things here.

                          ***** TODO *****


2012-May-15 Add mnemonic tags to doc/todo items for ease of reference.

2012-Sep-04 Non-atomic trace

    lib/trace.c uses a global shared atomic variable to allocate space in the
    trace buffer. This introduces cache contention between cores. Eliminate the
    contention by allocating a separate buffer for each core. Find out how to do
    this in user space (assembly is allowed). In kernel, use per-cpu
    variables. Each core should still use an atomic variable, because tracing
    can be called asynchronously from signal or interrupt handler. In user
    space, each buffer should be mapped to a separate file. Modify
    initialisation and parsing code accordingly.

2012-Sep-16 UT memory leaks

    Plug memory leaks, reported by UT.  Check `Leaked:' lines of UT
    output; any non-zero value may denote a defect.

    A leakage in test suite "foo-ut" can be investigated with command
        valgrind --leak-check=full utils/.libs/lt-ut -t foo-ut

2012-Nov-29 rpc: use m0_cookie for sender-id

2012-Nov-29 change console/ to use m0_xcode_read() instead of yaml

2012-Nov-29 gccxml: add M0_XCA_ENUM

    Add a M0_XCA_ENUM macro that would instruct gccxml to generate an array with
    human-readable enum names:

    enum m0_foo {
            F_ONE   = 1,
            F_TWO   = 2,
            F_THREE = 3
    } M0_XCA_ENUM(m0_foo_names);

    generates in the corresponding _xc.[ch] file something like

    struct m0_xcode_enum m0_foo_names[] = {
            { F_ONE, 1, "F_ONE" },
            { F_TWO, 2, "F_TWO" },
            { F_THREE, 2, "F_THREE" },
            { 0, 0, NULL }
    };

    where

    struct m0_xcode_enum {
            uint64_t    xe_tag;
            uint64_t    xe_value;
            const char *xe_name;
    };

    This array can be used by generic error-reporting functions and by
    m0_xcode_read() to accept symbolic constants.

2012-Nov-29 Alignment checks in xcode.

    On-wire data-types must be portable across platforms:

        u32 is always aligned on 4 byte boundary;

        u64 is always aligned on 8 byte boundary;

    This must be checked by m0_xcode_type_invariant() recursively, taking unions
    and sequences into account.

    (Re-write m0_xcode_type_invariant() in conjunction-style, while here.)

2012-Nov-29 ioservice: don't call m0_cs_stob_domain_find() at run-time

    Associate ioservice instance with a particular stob domain when the service
    is started.

2012-Nov-29 cleanup mero/mero-pub.api

    Meaningful interfaces should be exported, not partial unusable ones.

2013-Apr-30 sort the output of `ut.sh -l'

    `sudo utils/ut.sh -l' command outputs 63 unsorted lines, despite
    the names of test suite _variables_ being sorted in utils/ut_main.c.
    We need to sort the strings themselves, not only variable names.

2014-Feb-27 enforce uniqueness of magic values

    `scripts/check-sources' should check uniqueness of magic numbers
    in mero/magic.h.

                          ***** IN-PROGRESS *****

2012-Sep-05 Usage of m0_*_awkward() with signal handler and intrupt handler.

                          ***** DONE *****

2012-Oct-05 [Rajanikant]  Add lib/thread.h:m0_is_awkward(), implement in kernel
	    and user space. Tag code. m0_is_awkward() should return true iff the
            context is unsafe for blocking and locking (interrupt handler,
            signal handler, timer call-back, chan call-back, &c.).
            In kernel this is in_irq(). In user space, this should be based on
            pthread_getspecific(). Timer and chan call-backs should be handled.

	    Timer & chan call-backs handled.

2012-May-09 [Dima] Replace all debugging printf-s and printk-s with M0_LOG()-s

2012-Jul-26 [Dave] Call m0_processors_init() in m0_init(). Get rid of explicit
            m0_processors_init() calls.

2012-Jul-26 [Dave] m0_time_t is now a scalar with architecture-independent
            semantics (nanoseconds since epoch). Replace calls to
            m0_time_{before,after,...}() with direct comparisons.

2012-May-04 [Amit] .gdbinit macros for basic Mero structures

    Add to .gdbinit file gdb macros to display core Mero structures:
    lists, vectors, &c. Preferably, the macros should be placed in .gdbinit
    files, located in the corresponding modules, with top-level .gdbinit loading
    them.

2012-May-04 Add all magic numbers to doc/magix

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in reqh_service.c

    Use lists based on M0_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-04 Use tailored type-safe lists in setup.c

    Use lists based on M0_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-22 Use tailored type safe lists in rpc

    Use lists based on M0_TL_{DEFINE,DESCR}()

2012-May-14 Use #pragma once in headers [2012-Aug-01]

2012-Jul-26 Use gcc builtins __sync_fetch_and_add, ... for use-space
            m0_atomic64. Check first, that this is supported by our target
            compiler version [2012-Aug-07]

2012-Aug-22 Add m0_ut_ prefixes to all non-static unit test functions.

2012-Jul-26 addb context should be embedded in reqh.
2012-Sep-04 addb context should be embedded in reqh, instead of being referenced
            by pointer (m0_reqh::rh_addb).

2012-Aug-01 -include "config.h"

    Add `-include "config.h"' compiler option (possibly to CFLAGS of
    configure.ac). Delete `#include "config.h"' directives from source
    files; remove the corresponding stanza from doc/source-structure.

2012-Jul-26 Get rid of m0_fom::fo_fol, use fom->fo_service->rs_reqh->rh_fol
            instead. [2012-Sep-04]

2012-Aug-28 Magic delimiters [2012-Sep-10]

    Change magic values to follow 0x33xxxxxxxxxxxx77 pattern.
    Such "delimiters" are supposed to increase discoverability of
    magic values in a memory dump.

    Numbers 0x33 and 0x77 originate from Nikita's response to "magic
    numbers generator" thread[1].  Magic values can be generated with
    vvv's script[2].

        [1] https://groups.google.com/a/xyratex.com/forum/#!msg/grp-mero-dev/q6BpJsA4hSU/_jzBzjKeMbYJ
        [2] https://github.com/vvv/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/magic-gen.pl

2012-Jul-26 Use type-safe lists in fom.[ch].

2012-Jul-26 Replace atomic m0_fom_domain::fd_foms_nr with
            m0_fom_domain_is_idle() function that iterates over all localities
            and checks that queues are empty.

2012-Dec-10 Embed m0_sm in m0_rpc_{session,conn,item}

2012-Nov-29 M0_IN(): evaluate x only once

2012-Nov-29 Kill unused ->sdo_block_shift()

2012-Nov-29 get rid of m0_stob_io_*lock()

    remove unused m0_stob_io_*lock() functions and corresponding methods in
    m0_stob_op.

2012-Nov-29 use "sdl_" prefix for ->use_directio and ->linux_setup

2012-Nov-29 use the same fid and the same fid xc structure everywhere.

    Multiple definitions of fid are used by various sub-systems. Unify.

2012-Dec-10 Use m0_time_from_now() wherever possible.

   There are many places that compute `now + delta` as
   m0_time_add(m0_time_now(), delta);
   Replace all such occurrences with simpler m0_time_from_now().

2012-Nov-29 Convert .ff files to gccxml annotations where possible.

2012-Dec-26 enforce M0_ASSERT() and M0_CNT_{INC,DEC}()

    Add the following to lib/misc.h:
#define M0_HAS_SIDE_EFFECTS(expr) \
({ char _d[1]; __builtin_object_size(((void)(expr), _d), 0) == (size_t)-1; })

    Then with M0_CASSERT() check that arguments of M0_CNT_{INC,DEC}()
    and M0_ASSERT() have no side effects.

Outcome: not possible, because proposed M0_HAS_SIDE_EFFECTS() is conservative
and returns true for a function from another compilation unit.

2012-Sep-04 External lock in m0_chan.

    m0_chan::ch_guard is used to protect list of channel waiters
    (m0_chan::ch_links). However, in majority of cases, this list is accessed
    when some other lock is already held. This results in taking and releasing
    lock for no actual reason.

    Remove ->ch_guard and modify m0_chan interface to take a pointer to an
    external lock as a parameter to m0_chan_init(). Check that this lock is held
    when m0_clink_{add,del}(), m0_chan_{signal,broadcast}(), &c. are
    called. m0_chan_wait() and m0_clink_signal() do not need the lock.

    The same lock protects the lock invariant and it should be temporarily taken
    to check the invariant, if necessary.

    Identify locks protecting existing channels and add such locks when there is
    none.

2012-Nov-29 sm_timeout_top(): should use CAS

    The same in sm_timeout_cancel() to avoid races. See fom_clink_cb().
