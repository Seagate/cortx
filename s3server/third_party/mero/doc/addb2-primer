Addb (Analytic and Diagnostic Data-Base) is a Mero sub-system that collects
information about system behaviour ("telemetry information").

Mero code is instrumented to produce addb records describing events (for
example, memory allocations, error conditions, incoming fops, fom phase and
state transition), operational parameters (queue depths, operation latencies,
etc.) and statistical aggregates.

Addb records produced on storage-less clients are transmitted over network to
servers. Servers store records, both received from clients and produced locally,
in dedicated storage stobs.

Example
.......

Run Mero m0t1fs tests:

$ sudo ./m0t1fs/linux_kernel/st/m0t1fs_test.sh

This locally starts 3 md services and 4 ioservices in directories
/var/mero/systest-$PID/{ios,mds}$N. Each server has its own addb2 stob:

$ ls -l /var/mero/systest-*/????/addb-stobs/o/*2
-rwx------ 1 root root 48955392 Apr 14 15:46 /var/mero/systest-27554/ios1/addb-stobs/o/0000000000000002

(there are also addb-stobs/o/*1 files, created by the older version of addb).

Addb2 stobs can be examined by m0addb2dump utility:

$ # Note that full path to the stob must be used.
$ # Multiple stobs can be specified on the command line.
$ ./utils/m0run m0addb2dump -- /var/mero/systest-27554/????/addb-stobs/o/*2 |less

The output consists of records, formatted as following:

* 2015-10-24-04:21:44.073956527 clock
|         node             <11186d8bf0e34117:ab1897c062a22573>
|         locality         0

A line starting with '*' is a "measurement", it describes an event or
parameter. Following lines, starting with '|', are measurement's context. In
this case, the measurement is a time-stamp, and its context specifies the node
and the locality where the measurement was taken (i.e., where time stamp was
generated).

A few more examples:

* 2015-10-24-04:21:44.073956527 m0t1fs-create <4700000000000000:10007>, mode: 100644, rc: 0

|         thread           ffff88007407ca80, 7081

This is a client-originated record. The measurement records file creation
operation in m0t1fs.

Record of a memory allocation, which happened when a fom in "Zero-copy finish"
phase launched AD-stob IO, which incurred Linux-stob IO.

This record describes fom state transition. Note the "fom" label in the context:
it describes the fom which undergoes the phase transition.

Such records (always going one after another) describe new fom. First record is
a generic fom description, second record is specific to the fom type (cob read
request in our case).

There are two types of measurements:

    * measurements corresponding to something that happens in a particular
      moment in particular place of code are technically called
      "data-points". All records above, except for the first one, are examples
      of data-points;

    * other measurements correspond to parameters that change "continuously",
      that is, too fast for each change to be sampled individually. Such
      measurements are called "sensors". Addb2 periodically samples sensors and
      records their measurements. Sensor records always include the time-stamp
      of the moment when the sensor was sampled.

"Clock" is a sensor. Other examples of sensors are:

* 2015-04-15-13:04:19.614626769 fom-active nr: 24 min: 1 max: 2 avg: 1.500000 dev: 0.250000
|         node             <b0cf922c851b42c4:89028b3a5eeded41>
|         locality         0
* 2015-04-15-13:04:19.614627234 runq nr: 242 min: 0 max: 2 avg: 0.657025 dev: 0.382368
|         node             <b0cf922c851b42c4:89028b3a5eeded41>
|         locality         0
* 2015-04-15-13:04:19.614627526 wail nr: 218 min: 0 max: 2 avg: 0.940367 dev: 0.496444
|         node             <b0cf922c851b42c4:89028b3a5eeded41>
|         locality         0

Which are, respectively, total number of foms in the locality given by the
context, number of foms in locality run-queue and locality wait-list.

Important sensors are fom phase transition counters:

* 2015-04-15-13:04:18.607430792 Read request/IO fom: fom_tx_wait -[Transaction opened]-> IO Prepare nr: 5 min: 131 max: 898 avg: 379.600000 dev: 88701.040000 datum: 0
|         node             <b0cf922c851b42c4:89028b3a5eeded41>
|         locality         1

This counter measures time spent in a particular phase transition for foms of
particular type in a particular locality. Note that:

    * this is statistical aggregate. Unless "nr" is 1, data for multiple foms
      are accumulated in the measurement. In the example above, 5 foms executed
      given state transition in the locality 1;

    * the data are for foms of particular type. Not all fom types have such
      counters configured for them;

    * the data are for specific locality, indicated in the context;

    * the counter is reset to 0 each time it is sampled. That is, the counter
      shows the time spent in the given phase transition since last time this
      counter was recorded.

There is a similar counter for fom *state* transitions:

* 2015-04-15-13:03:13.656801304 /FOM states: Ready -[Run]-> Running nr: 124 min: 3 max: 297 avg: 11.580645 dev: 698.808012 datum: 0
|         node             <b0cf922c851b42c4:89028b3a5eeded41>
|         locality         0

This counter is shared by foms of all types. There are also separate fom state transitions for some fop types:

* 2015-04-20-14:36:13.572621581 Write request/FOM states: Ready -[Run]-> Running nr: 6 min: 3 max: 6 avg: 5.166667 dev: 1.138889 datum: 0
|         node             <f3b62b87d9e642b2:96a4e0520cc5477b>
|         locality         1

Flattening addb2dump stream
...........................

Default m0addb2dump output is suitable for human reader, but not very convenient
for ad-hoc queries and parsing by line-oriented tools (grep, sed, awk), because
context and measurement are on separate lines.

addb2dump has options '-f' (flattan output) and '-d' (de-flatten input) converts
between m0addb2dump output format and line-oriented format. Output is
"flattened" by by appending context labels to the measurement line. E.g., the
"clock" record above becomes

* 2015-04-14-15:32:02.395575233 clock         |         node             <11186d8bf0e34117:ab1897c062a22573> |         locality         0

(as one line).

'-d' converts its input back into default m0addb2dump format.

Example use:

m0addb2dump -f $INPUT | grep forq-duration | sort -k4,4 | m0addb2dump -d | less

This finds all addb2 records describing fork-queue AST processing, sorts them by
processing time and displays results.

A more sophisticated query would be:

$ m0addb2dump -f $INPUT | \
     grep 'Write.*committed.*nr: [^0]' | awk '{print $30}' | sort | uniq -c

which finds all records about WRITE foms transition to the "transaction
committed" phase, extracts locality number ($27) from records and counts how
many times foms committed in each locality.

To find how much memory is allocated for a particular fom, given by its address:

$ m0addb2dump -f $PWD/ios1/addb-stobs/o/*2 |\
       grep '^\* [-0-9:.]* alloc.*fom *@0x7fab90041270' |\
       awk '{print $5; sum += $5} END {print "Total:", sum}'
