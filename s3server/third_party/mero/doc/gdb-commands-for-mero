GDB extension for Mero:
--------------------------

There are two ways to write "user defined GDB commands".
1. Create a named batch of GDB commands using 'define' command
2. Using Python
Each of these two ways has their own benefits and drawbacks
e.g. compactness vs flexibility

We are using both these mechanisms to write GDB commands to print Mero
specific objects.

scripts/gdb/gdb-extensions and scripts/gdb/gdb-extensions.py define "user
defined GDB commands" for Mero. gdb-extensions defines commands using GDB's
'define' command, whereas all Python based GDB commands go in gdb-extensions.py.
These two file are automatically loaded from the top-level .gdbinit file which
located in the root directory of mero git repository.

To see list of mero related commands do:
(gdb) apropos m0
m0-bufvec-print -- Prints segments in m0_bufvec
m0-fop-types-list-print --     Prints global list of registered fop types
m0-indexvec-print -- Prints segments in m0_indexvec
m0-list-print -- Prints m0_list/m0_tl elements
m0-rpc-conn-print-sessions --     Prints list of sessions within connection

Use "help <m0-command-name>" to know more about the command and its usage.
These commands have detailed help with examples.

container_of() and offsetof() macros are now also available in gdb:
(gdb) macro list
macro define container_of(ptr, type, member) ((type *)((char *)(ptr)-(char *)(&((type *)0)->member)))
macro define offsetof(typ, memb) ((unsigned long)((char *)&(((typ *)0)->memb)))


Sample output:

Same m0-list-print command works with both m0_list and m0_tl, with same syntax.
