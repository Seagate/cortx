UDP: Incorrect. If recv() returns the same length it was given, the message was
either that length or greater. There is no way of telling which. The correct
technique is to use a buffer one greater than the largest possible datagram
expected. Then if you get that length, it must have been an error on the
sender's part.

EINPROGRESS
              The socket is nonblocking and the connection cannot be
              completed immediately.  (UNIX domain sockets failed with
              EAGAIN instead.)  It is possible to select(2) or poll(2) for
              completion by selecting the socket for writing.  After
              select(2) indicates writability, use getsockopt(2) to read the
              SO_ERROR option at level SOL_SOCKET to determine whether
              connect() completed successfully (SO_ERROR is zero) or
              unsuccessfully (SO_ERROR is one of the usual error codes
              listed here, explaining the reason for the failure).



1. When the connection completes successfully, the descriptor becomes writable (p. 531 of TCPv2).
2. When the connection establishment encounters an error, the descriptor becomes both readable and writable (p. 530 of TCPv2).


TODO-------------

Get rid of #define ntm_mutex ntm_group.s_lock

rpc.c: seg_size/seg_nr functions:

   - rename (they are for netbuf pools)

   - fix for sock

Compare provisioning behaviour

Avoid port collisions: switch to native endpoint names

Support multiple completions for receive buffers (RETAIN)

Changes to RPC-----

Finite timeout on SEND buffers.
