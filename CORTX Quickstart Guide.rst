CORTX Quickstart Guide
#######################

To contribute to the CORTX Open-Source project, you'll need to understand how the CORTX repository is classified. The CORTX project is made up of three repositories. 

The CORTX repository is the first component and the parent repository that contains top-level documentation about the CORTX Community. The CORTX-motr repository contains Motr files and is the second component of the CORTX project. Motr forms the central component that renders object and key-value storage. The last and the S3 interface for the CORTS-motr is the CORTX-S3 repository. 

We welcome your contributions to any of the three components. Sometimes, you might find it a challenge to decide the component that you need to submit your contributions. We suggest that you use your best judgment or reach out to us via our communications channels. We may change the location of your contributions at our discretion during the code review process.
