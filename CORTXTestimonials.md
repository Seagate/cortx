# Community Testimonials

The CORTX project is world's only 100% Open Source Mass-Capacity Optimized Object Store solution. We are comitted to creating an eco-system for research and development around storage that is better, more economical, and changed the way the world looks at data and storage. Read what our community members who have deployed CORTX in their environments have to say.

## CEA

- "CORTX is now proving to be very powerful and flexible object storage, which can be used very effectively to implement very large-scale data storage. CORTX can very nicely work with storage tools and many different types of storage interfaces. We have effectively used CORTX to implement a parallel file system interface (pNFS) and hierarchical storage management tools. CORTX architecture is also compatible with artificial intelligence and deep learning (AI/DL) tools such as TensorFlow.”

## DCBLOX

- "DC BLOX deploys our resilient edge connected colocation, networking, and storage infrastructure for enabling today's digital business across the Southeastern US. We are thrilled to take part in Seagate's beta testing of its Lyve Drive platform; when generally available, we will deploy Lyve to help DC BLOX customers move data around the edge, enterprise, and cloud conveniently, securely, and easily. DC BLOX values Seagate’s leadership in tackling the rapidly increasing challenge of large-scale data storage and management with its CORTX object storage system. Seagate’s storage innovation combined with DC BLOX’s data center and network infrastructure address growing industry need and we are very excited to be a part of a combined solution.”

## GitHub

- “Seagate delivers an open platform, with all the feature sets and roadmaps driven by the community—for the community. It’s the kind of setting in which innovation happens,” 

  - **Jeff McAffer, Senior Director of Product**

## Intel

- “Open source innovation in high-performance storage is critical to propel cloud, HPC, AI and communications networks to higher levels of performance in the coming data era,” said Bryan Jorgensen, Vice President in Intel’s Data Platforms Group. “Intel plans to work within the CORTX Community to enable and optimize this exciting open source technology with our relevant platform features, including Intel Optane persistent memory, Intel QuickAssist accelerators, and the DAOS file system. We will also be working with Seagate to integrate those same technology innovations within the mass capacity-optimized Lyve Drive Rack reference design.”

## Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz

- "The open-source project CORTX pools the expertise of leading industry and research groups within a focused development process. We are happy to be part of this CORTX community and to work with many storage experts on extending CORTX by including hybrid online/offline deduplication strategies."
    - **André Brinkmann**

## Los Alamos National Lab

- "As HPC Division Leader at Los Alamos National Lab, I am vigilant for opportunities to reduce the cost and complexity of our distributed data platforms. I am very excited to see what Seagate is doing with CORTX and am optimistic about its ability to lower costs for data storage at the exabyte scale. We are gratified to see Seagate embracing the technologies that we believe are important to maximize data durability, such as multi-level erasure encodings. We will be closely following the open source CORTX and will participate in the community built around it, because we share Seagate's goal of economically efficient storage optimized for massive scalability and durability." 

  - **Gary Grider, HPC Division Leader**

## Supermicro

- “At Supermicro, we are seeing greater desire from our customers to balance costs, increase operational efficiencies while mitigating risks associated with vendor lock-in, security and regulatory compliance by going the hybrid cloud route,” said Vik Malyala, senior vice president, Supermicro. “Given this and combined with the need to support varying requirements of enterprise workloads, we are excited to partner with Seagate on Lyve Drive Rack reference architecture and support scalable open-source infrastructure solutions on Supermicro’s resource-saving platforms."
