## Project management tools

First time I'm setting up a python project with proper management tools. Let this be a proof of concept.

### Poetry

package manager

### safety

`poetry add safety`

Scans for knows vulnerabilities.

### .editorconfig

Styleguide for multi language projects.

### Pre-commit

`poetry add pre-commit`

Runs checks before a commit.

### MyPy

Static type checker.

### nitpick

`poetry run nitpick check/fix`
Checks the project for structural correctness and fixes issues.
