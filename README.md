# CORTX.  Hyperscale storage stack capabilities for all.

In consultation with IDC, Seagate has determined that an immense amount of data (175 zettabytes) will be created in 2025.  Surprisingly, of this data, IDC predicts that only 17 zettabytes (about 10%) will be stored.  This at-risk 158 zettabytes of data slated to be discarded will have a tremendous amount of unrealized potential as multiple research efforts have determined that the accuracy of machine learning and data analytics directly correlates to the size of the input data set.  

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/at_risk_data.jpg?raw=true"></p>

As such, Seagate has worked hard to understand both the software and hardware requirements that would allow more of this 158 at-risk zettabytes to be stored.  We have discovered that the underlying hardware requires innovation to improve density per cost and that the software architecture itself is prohibitively expensive.  The result of this analysis is Seagate's conclusion that a new software architecture is needed both to satisfy the economic limitations of the existing systems as well as to ensure efficient utilization of the co-evolving hardware innovations.  

To ensure maximum utililization and code quality and to avoid vendor lock-in, Seagate is open-sourcing CORTX: a distributed object storage system designed for efficient, mass-capacity, HDD-utilization.

## The CORTX Community

We are so excited for you to be visiting us and reading this file and really hope you consider sticking around and being part of our community.  We take community very seriously and assure you that we are committed to all of the social goals of respectful interactions and inclusivity as documented in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  Check it out and, if it sounds like your kind of place, we bid you a warm welcome!

## The Early Adopter Program

Prior to our full open source launch, CORTX is now in a phase we are calling our _Early Adopter Program_.  During this period, we have opened our repositories and are sharing our development efforts with an external community comprised of trusted partners and customers.  Thank you all for your willingness and interest in this initiative.  We are so flattered that you share our vision for helping the world save more data through open source object storage!  Please read more about this initiative in our [Early Adopter Brief](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/tree/master/doc/SB510_1-2004US_Seagate_CORTX_Community-Brief_R7.2.pdf) and please, as always, ask any questions or provide any feedback in our various public communications channels or feel free to address any private questions or concerns to cortx-questions@seagate.com.

## How to Contribute

Please refer to our [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md) for detailed technical information about how to build and test the code as well as for suggested contributions and contribution guidelines.  Please refer to our [Style Guide](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/master/doc/CodeStyle.md) for a description of our code style guidelines.  Please refer to our [Suggested Contributions List](doc/SuggestedContributions.md) to find ideas about what contributions are currently being sought.

### Case Studies, Technical Content, and Blog Posts

One of our goals of the Early Adopter program is to create and collect content for the public launch of CORTX: case studies, contributor stories, solution briefs, and technical content such as code samples, recipes, API documentation, benchmarks, and reference architectures.

If, in the course of running and testing CORTX and making contributions, you solve a challenge (big or small) and are interested in working with us on developing a case study or other content, please get in touch with John Bent at john.bent@seagate.com.

We would also like to profile community members – their background, use cases, and contributions for ongoing blog posts.

In short, we need content! Whether you like to write or if you prefer to be interviewed and leave the writing to us, this is a great way to share your experience and expertise.
