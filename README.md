CORTX: World's Best Scalable Mass-Capacity Object Storage System
================================================================

The amount of data the world is creating and collecting is increasing
massively. The amount of data the world is storing is not. The models
and machine learning that are at the forefront of some of the most
important research today depend on access to compete data sets, but
limitations on storage lead to unnecessary data loss. By creating
better, more economical storage solutions, we enable the research that
is changing the world.

The CORTX Project
-----------------

CORTX is a distributed object storage system designed for great
efficiency, massive capacity, and high HDD-utilization.

### CORTX Project Scope & Core Design Goals

| Project Scope      | Core Design Goals                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Processor agnostic | Works with any processor.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Flexibility        | Highly flexible, works with HDD, SSD, and NVM.                                                                                                                                   |
| Scalability        | Massively Scalable. Scales up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206) and 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects with unlimited object sizes. |
| Responsiveness     | Rapidly Responsive. Quickly retrieves data regardless of the scale using a novel Key-Value System that ensures low search latency across massive data sets.                      |
| Resilience         | Highly Resilient. Ensures a high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding, while remaining fully RAID-compatible.       |
| Transparency       | Provides specialized telemetry data and unmatched insight into system performance.                                                                                               |

CORTX Community Values 
---------------------

-   **Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is,
    too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are
    wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project
    that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.
-   **Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We
    believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available
    to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock-in or other
    in-built limitations.
-   **Inspired** - CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not
    small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity
    object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and
    interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work,
    ingenuity, and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and
    find inspired solutions.
-   **Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a
    community project, there is no limit to its development. We
    continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities
    offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects.
