# CORTX: Creating The World’s Best Scalable Mass-Capacity Object Storage System

The amount of data the world is creating and collecting is increasing massively. The amount of data the world is storing is not. The models and machine learning that are at the forefront of some of the most important research today depend on access to compete data sets. By creating better, more economical storage solutions, we enable the research that is changing the world.  

<p align="center"><img src="../assets/images/at_risk_data.jpg?raw=true"></p>

# Project Scope and Core Design Goals:

* **Processor Agnostic** – adaptable to any processor
* **Flexible** – works with HDD, SSD, and NVM
* **Massively Scalable** – up to a billion billion billion billion billion exabytes (2^206), 1.3 billion billion billion billion (2^120) objects, and with unlimited object sizes
* **Faster retrieval regardless of scale** – using a novel Key Value System to ensure low search latency even across massive data sets. 
* **Resilient** – while remaining fully RAID compatible, Network Erasure Coding ensures an even higher tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times than traditional recovery schemes.  
* **Transparent performance** – provides specialized telemetry data, granting unmatched insight into system performance. 

## CORTX Community Values

**Inclusive** - Our ambitions are global. The CORTX community is, too. The perspectives and skills necessary to achieve our goals are wide and varied; we believe in creating a community and a project that is inclusive, accessible, and welcoming to everyone.

**Open** - We are dedicated to remaining open and transparent. We believe in keeping CORTX Community code freely and fully available to be viewed, modified, and used without vendor lock in or other in-built limitations.

**Inspired**- CORTX is all about the challenge. Our goals are not small: we want to build the world’s best scalable mass-capacity object storage system, one that can work with any hardware and interoperate with all workloads. CORTX is built on hard work, ingenuity and an engineering mindset. We embrace hard problems and find inspired solutions.

**Evolving** – CORTX is continuously growing and adapting. As a community project, there is no limit to its development. We continuously make room for improvement and welcome the opportunities offered by the ever-evolving nature of community projects. 

We excited for your interest in CORTX and hope you will join us.  We take community very seriously and we are committed to creating a community built on respectful interactions and inclusivity as documented in our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

## How to Contribute

Please refer to our [Quick Start Guide](QUICK_START.md) for detailed technical information about how to build and test the code as well as for suggested contributions and contribution guidelines.  Please refer to our [Style Guide](https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/master/doc/CodeStyle.md) for a description of our code style guidelines.  Please refer to our [Suggested Contributions List](doc/SuggestedContributions.md) to find ideas about what contributions are currently being sought.

### Case Studies, Technical Content, and Blog Posts

One of our goals of the early stages of the CORTX project is to create and collect content to support the CORTX project: case studies, contributor stories, solution briefs, and technical content such as code samples, recipes, API documentation, benchmarks, and reference architectures.

If, in the course of running and testing CORTX and making contributions, you solve a challenge (big or small) and are interested in working with us on developing a case study or other content, please get in touch with John Bent at john.bent@seagate.com.

We would also like to profile community members – their background, use cases, and contributions for ongoing blog posts.

In short, we want to showcase your contributions and experiences! Whether you like to write or if you prefer to be interviewed and leave the writing to us, we want to recognize our community and highlight the interesting work everyone is doing.
