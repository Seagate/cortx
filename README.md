## The CORTX Project

CORTX is Seagate's proof-of-concept research project into distributed object storage systems, with an emphasis on HPC, efficiency, massive capacity, and high HDD-utilization.  **CORTX is 100% Open Source.** Most of the project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](../main/LICENSE) and the rest is under AGPLv3; check the specific License file for each submodule to determine which is which.

### CORTX Design Goals & Research Areas

| Project Scope      | Core Design Goals                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mass capacity | Optimizing Object Storage for mass capacity storage devices       .                                                                                                       |
| Processor agnostic | Should work with any processor.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Flexibility        | Able to work with HDD, SSD, and NVM.                                                                                                                                   |
| Scalability        | Solving mass-capacity scaling challenges |
| Responsiveness     | Improving data retrieval speeds in high scale systems and ensuring low latency across large data sets                   |
| Resilience         | Ensuring a high tolerance for hardware failure and faster rebuild and recovery times using Network Erasure Coding |
| Transparency       | Improving observability                                                                                           |
